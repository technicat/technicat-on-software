This is why I regret making a paid Google Play app:

Every time I update the paid version of HyperBowl on Google Play, hitting the Publish button effectively pushes it to a few dozen pirate sites, where the latest version magically appears within a few hours.

And then if I complain about it, I get people telling me what a great opportunity piracy is, and since I can’t stop it, I might as well embrace it (which is a pretty creepy thing to say, if you think about it). One piracy advocate who insisted he wasn’t pro-piracy even suggested I upload a special pirate edition to compete with the pirated versions (You know, one stupid argument just ruins any not-so-stupid arguments you might have accidentally had).

The same person also said it’s preferable to have someone pirate the app than complain they want their $.99 back (or threaten to leave a one-star review if they didn’t get the changes they want in a week, which actually happened). I might agree with that, but I’d prefer it even more if they neither threatened me nor stole from me.

I actually have more good reviews than negative reviews (I’m tempted to generalize that paying users give better reviews, but that’s not the case with this same game on the Amazon Appstore, and the free version of HyperBowl on Google Play gets decent reviews). So I feel obligated to keep the paid version updated, at least for major changes. I just have to grit my teeth a bit when I hit the Publish button, and say to all you pirate site operators deriving web ad revenue from my game: you’re welcome (not really).
