Now that the Windows version of HyperBowl is on Steam (the Mac version was released first, two weeks earlier), the reviews are starting to come in. The first one is terse, but I’ll take it.

The second one is much more detailed, but still overall positive.

If I knew more than a few words of Japanese, I’d translate this for you, but for now here’s the Google Translate version.

    Bowling game in various places.
    Android and iTunes, also distributed in the Microsoft Store, which is Win 10 in terms of system requirements, but it worked on my Win 7 as well.
    The language is supported only in English, but the menu is also displayed in Japanese.

    WASD and arrow keys, operate the ball with the mouse. Since it manipulates the ball itself, it is possible to retreat, but if it goes to just before pin, it will only proceed with inertia. It is easy to operate, but because of the good response, I can not feel the weight feeling of the ball.

    There are 6 kinds of lanes prepared. There are lanes that cross the city from a straight lane without obstacles, and lanes that roll balls while swaying on the deck of the ship. (I can not confirm the lane of the snowy mountain which was in the PV)
    While striking various gimmicks with a momentum aiming at the pin, it is unique and interesting that the ball rolls in an unexpected direction unexpectedly.

    Sorry to lack refreshing feeling because you can not feel the weight feeling on the ball in various aspects such as operability, rolling speed, reaction when you hit an obstacle, sound and so on.
    Because it collides with a car of the same size and is frontal collision and kicked off with a pawn, it may be hollow inside.

    There is a place where the ball bounces even though the step is inside, there is no BGM, the shout at the time of strike is meaning unknown, even as a party game or as a bakage game, Ala stands out as a sports game. But it’s not going to be funny, it’s an impact-oriented game.
    If you come to see the PV and come with the pin, you buy it at the fixed price and think that it is a work that can be enjoyed a bit and it can be enjoyed.
