If you’re like me, that first review after you submit an app has an inordinate impact. Getting a sucky review is depressing and makes you wonder if it was all worth it. Getting a mean and sucky review is depressing and maddening and makes you wonder if it was all worth it.

But a review from someone who really really likes it? That makes it all worthwhile (at least, as long as I put aside my dreams of retiring on app revenue). And it sure makes the app store page look better. So I’m positively relieved the first review of HyperBowl on the Mac App Store is a good one. I declare victory.
