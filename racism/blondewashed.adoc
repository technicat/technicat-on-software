The whitewashing of Hollywood is old news. And hey, I’ve been boycotting the Oscars for a long time, just because it’s long and boring (and I’m talking about the red carpet portion).

The trend that concerns me now is that you can’t shake a stick without seeing these Outbrain-style ads. Not only are they tawdry in a tabloid way (it’s the new look — the Huffington Post has gone all in), they present a world populated mostly by blond women (much like 70’s television) with a token minority and brunette (much like 70’s television).

As with the CNN web site presenting mostly Trump stories, I have no interest in what they’re showing in general, but even crap should have balance and diversity.
