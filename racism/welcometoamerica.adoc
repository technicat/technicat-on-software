Welcome to America!

I’ve seen a lot of stories related on twitter about Americans being told to go back to their “home” country, and I’ve been fortunate to never experience that (as far as I can remember).

On the contrary, I’ve been greeted with “Welcome to America!” and attempts at hello in Mandarin. Also, I’ve received friendly inquiries on matters such as where I’m from and no where am I really from, what’s my nationality, how long I’ve been in this country (I give my age), and compliments on my English and the politeness of my people.

But “Welcome to America!” is just a bad mood short of “Go back to your country!” Which is just a bad president short of internment camps (please, no more quotes on freedom from FDR). The problem isn’t the obnoxious “go back” part, it’s the insidious “your country” as in not this country. And there are a lot of people in this country who think that just based on how you look.
