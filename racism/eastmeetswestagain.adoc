Well, I missed this, but interesting as it may have been, I wouldn’t have attended anything called “East Meets West.” It’s not the first time I’ve seen an exhibition with that title: it’s basically shorthand for “hey white people, come check out all this exotic Asian stuff!” (I recall the Huntington Beach library had a statue from Asia on loan and promptly advertised it as “East Meets West!”)

But East Meets West is not just for art. It’s also the go-to headline or name for anything remotely or supposely Asian (like a karaoke bar with beer pong, but OK, I guess that works).

Out of curiosity, I also googled “west meets east”, and that also gets a lot of hits, but generally of a less hackneyed, more interesting variety, like this album by Ravi Shankar and Yehudi Menuhin. Now, that’s something I’d have gone to see!
