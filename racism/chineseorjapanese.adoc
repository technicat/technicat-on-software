Chinese or Japanese?

I met an artist from New York the other day, and I could tell he’s from New York from, well, the accent, and also because he almost immediately asked “Are you Chinese or Japanese?”

First of all, that’s a weird question for someone you just met. I don’t go around asking white people, “Are you Irish or Italian?” for example. He did seem taken aback when I asked “Where are you from?” (and by the way I get that a lot, too).

But including my time in New York and Boston, I’ve met quite a few New Englanders determined to peg one’s Asian ancestry and country of origin (typically assumed to be the same), often armed with bizarre followup questions like “You guys don’t like Koreans, right?” or “I was thinking of buying a Hyundai and I thought you could give me some tips” (these are real).

And why are Chinese and Japanese the only two choices? Based on the type of restaurants he’s frequented? But that specific phrasing sounded really familiar, and later I remembered where I’ve heard it before:

King of the Hill takes place in Texas, but to me, that’s all New England.
