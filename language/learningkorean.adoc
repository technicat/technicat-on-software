Learning Korean

When I started my kdrama kick several years ago, after going internet-only for my TV viewing and discovering the Korean genre listing on Hulu, I thought I’d pick up some Korean language from watching several entire series.

So let’s see, if ten thousand hours is the magic number, then divide that by an average 20 hours per series, I only need to watch five hundred shows. But so far, I can only recognize key words like thank you, a few foods, family members, I love you, and your highness. Really useful stuff.

Naturally, I turned to apps for help. There is even a Kdrama Talk app on the App Store. If you don’t watch kdrama, this will give you an idea of the content.

But right now I’m having more success with Word Fireworks, which forces me to learn how to read and write individual characters and syllables (Korean syllables are conveniently grouped into clusters of two or three alphabetic characters — so much easier than Chinese), as they fall down the screen.

My Fugu Type app is a tiny bit similar, but Word Fireworks is a thousand times better (I have to go back and redo that typing app one of these days).
