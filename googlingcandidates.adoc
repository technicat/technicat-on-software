When I moved to Nevada two years ago, I thought the early elections they have here are great (you can vote in the malls, grocery stores, on weekends…), but still not as convenient as the mail-in ballots I filled out in California.

But this year, I received a letter encouraging me to get an absentee ballot (really, a mail-in ballot — don’t have to be absentee to), pointing out that I can google candidates in the convenience of my own home.

So I did (just voting along party lines is better than not voting at all, but c’mon, put some effort into it). It can be tedious, but also entertaining. For example, the candidate who listed among her qualifications as being old enough to run. And the 1990s want their web sites back.
