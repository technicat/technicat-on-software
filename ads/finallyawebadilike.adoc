I really don’t like this new trend of web ads with graphics that make even reputable sites look like tabloids, but finally, (and more evidence that the do-not-track preference in my browser is totally ignored), I’m presented with a pleasing ad.

I’m talking about the book at top center, which I authored and is the first marketing for the book I’ve seen since it was published one Unity generation ago (Unity is at version 5.3, now). But it’s getting cheaper!

I’m a bit disappointed the title is just descriptive, instead of “This is just the perfect Unity book!” or “Your jaw will drop when you see what’s inside this book!” or “The secret tips in this book will blow your mind!” You get the idea.
