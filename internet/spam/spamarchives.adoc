Over ten years ago, I retired the first email address I set up for my game dev business because of a constant stream of spam (I think due to it being listed in gamasutra) but every once in a while I have to reactive it temporarily to do some business and then deactivate it again before my inbox fills up with spam again.

I had to do this again last night (for some reason I was still using that email address for Steam), and sure enough spam started coming in. Last time I complained about a spammer, they demanded I show them proof and threatened to hire a lawyer, so I’m going to try to keep copies around from now on.

So, at the risk of giving them free advertising, here’s a company that apparently has been mass emailing me for maybe the last fourteen years.
