This email from Toptal brings up a few questions. First, how did they get my github email address when it’s not public? And, foursquare? Did I check into the Google cafeteria?

    My name is Kevin and I work with Toptal, a network looking for elite freelance engineers all around the world.

    Please correct me if I am wrong, but I saw on GitHub and foursquare that you might be quite experienced in Android, iOS and JavaScript development.
