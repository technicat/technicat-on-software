I read a lot of prescient science fiction as a kid, but I don’t remember anyone, not even Asimov, predicting the amount of time I now spend on updating my social media profiles. For example, I spent this Saturday setting up my dramabeans profile.

On web sites (and apps) that have a white background, I usually choose the technicat logo I commissioned from Dakota Snow. You can see it at top right of the page and overlapping the bottom left of the banner, which is the technicat scene I created with WordsEye.

Now, customizing my presence on a web site about Korean soap operas might not seem like the best use of time, since I’ve got apps to release, money to make, and the rent to pay. But just yesterday, I saw this sign at a local coffee shop, and I agree with its sentiment.
