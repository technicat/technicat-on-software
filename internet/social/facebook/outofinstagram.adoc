Last decade was the decade I got into social media, and this decade is the decade I got out. Of Facebook and the Facebook family, anyway (still on Twitter, Pinterest, and obviously Medium). This year I bailed out of WhatsApp, gave up on my Oculus Rift because the updater didn’t work, then went through a multiphase unfollow-everyone-then-delete-pages sequence on Facebook proper, and just under the 2019 end-of-year wire, deleted Instagram last night.

The process of deleting an account often confirms my desire to delete the account. Like having to google for instructions on how to close the account. And then having to provide an answer why.

None of the stock answers seem to fit the bill. Subverting democracy? Too Orwellian? Liar liar pants on fire? Because you’re owned by Facebook?

Anyway, back to Pinterest.
