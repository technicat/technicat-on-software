But you can switch the display to show trends in other parts of the world via the gear icon at top right (it’s a bit more convenient on the web site). It’s not a very comprehensive list (good luck finding Hong Kong), but there are a few dozen countries you can choose from.

I thought I’d check out what our neighbors down south are tweeting and maybe practice my Spanish.

Speaking of Russia, I didn’t know K-pop is so popular there.
