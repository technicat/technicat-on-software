I’ve made fun of Medium for waxing creative (and at length) in their app update notes, but I think they’re on to something with their latest limerick.

I suppose there’s a risk of delaying updates if you run into writer’s block, so here’s a boilerplate rhyme:

    Yes there’s a bug in the app.

    But please don’t review it as crap.

    Fix it by updating,

    and give it a good rating,

    not just a sarcastic slow clap.
