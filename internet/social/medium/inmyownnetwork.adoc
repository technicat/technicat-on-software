I don’t often bother to check out the “New from your network” section of Medium since I have to scroll down to find it, but now that I just did, I noticed this oddity: several of the stories listed, maybe five total, are mine.

I’m in my own network? But unlike the other stories there, mine don’t have a “FROM YOUR NETWORK” header. And I don’t know how I feel about the all caps, especially since the section title is capitalized like a sentence.
