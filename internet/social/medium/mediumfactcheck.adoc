I saw this disclaimer on a Medium story.

My immediate reaction was wait, they fact-check stories? (And fact-check is hyphenated? Merriam-Webster says yes, but the Medium tag says no).

Or did they mean “any” instead of “every”? Really, the first part of the sentence pretty much says it all, so they could have said basically “Anyone can publish on Medium so we don’t fact-check.”

But I did see another story without the disclaimer.

That story was in one of the Medium publications, so maybe they did fact-check it. Or they trusted the author enough to consider it fact-checked.

Either way, shouldn’t the disclaimer read “Medium didn’t fact check this story”? And “Do you still want to pay to read it?”
