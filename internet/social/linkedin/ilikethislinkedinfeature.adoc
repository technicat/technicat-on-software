I Like This LinkedIn Feature

LinkedIn is in that category of social media that I use because everyone else uses it but I don’t really like it (Facebook is the other member of that category). I basically just use it as a professional rolodex.

The recruiter spam was the worst feature (made worse by the rating system where five stars just mean the recruiter had ten responses). I don’t know if the spamming is still there, since to turn it off I had to adjust my profile to indicate I wanted no job inquiries.

But I have to admit this new picture-yourself-at-this-company is seductive. I clicked on it a few times to see what other companies it matched me up with.

Anything that shows me jobs without recruiters getting in the way is a plus. Or even if they just let me give recruiters real ratings, I might enable inquiries again (get ready for those one-stars).
