Getting Off Medium

I’m almost done with my social media cleansing, deleted my facebook, whatsapp, instagram, twitter, tumblr, linkedin…but there’s still Medium. I love Medium as a writing tool, it’s an amazing browser-based word processor, but as much as I try to avoid looking at my feed, it’s still social media, or trying desperately to be (the curse of Web 2.0 is every useful idea has to be wrapped in a social media network).

For example, I thought it’d be cool to put my resume on Medium since I could make it look nice (which was what I wanted to use LinkedIn for, but it just looked like a crappy Craigslist post and served as recruiter-spam bait).

But I just checked it out, and Medium is pushing this (curated) garbage at the bottom, spanning unpleasant, tawdry, and insipid.

Hey, I need a job, so come see my resume and a bunch of clickbait! Not for the first time, I’m wondering if I should have stuck with my original Dreamhost and Wordpress setup, and maybe it’s time to check out new blogging options. After all, I’ve been on Medium five years now, and this was my first post.

I’m thinking, not anymore?
