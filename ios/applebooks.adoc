As I mentioned previously, my collection of software essays has been in Apple review limbo for the past year and a half, until they told me recently that the author name was not entered correctly. I was prepared to wait another two and a half years, but after only a couple of days (still slower than an app review), it was approved and now on the Apple Book Store (Apple Bookstore?)

You may notice the copyright year listed on the book is 2012. That’s when I (successfully) published it on Amazon and Barnes and Noble and (unsuccessfully) first tried it to publish it as an iBook. In the meantime, I have written some more articles/essays that could be added (for example, a HyperBowl postmortem). So maybe it’s time to update the book.
