While I was playing a game on my fancy gaming PC, it took me a while to find the tab key on my keyboard so I could proceed from the instructional dialog in the game. While I was searching, my character died from radiation damage.

Maybe it’s obvious to the rest of you, and a google search does show a conventional graphic used for tab keys.

But it’s hardly obvious to me that opposite arrow keys glommed together represents tab (especially since tabbing generally goes in one direction). And it doesn’t save any space. It’s just three letters, and there’s no icon for Alt or Esc on this keyboard. This seems like a classic case of form over function. Even Apple still spells out tab on their keyboards!
