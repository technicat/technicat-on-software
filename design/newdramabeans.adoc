As part of my time-consuming kdrama addiction (which is one reason why I’ll never achieve true greatness), I frequently read episode recaps on Dramabeans.

However, the web site did have some issues. The appearance was OK, perhaps a bit too colorful (besides black and white, at least four other recurring colors), and the dramabeans logo looked more like dramabongs or dramaballs. The biggest problem were the popup ads, which would often take over the screen on my iPad.

But just as I was seriously contemplating boycotting the site after the umpteenth time a spontaneous ad page wouldn’t let me back out, they revamped the site.

I think the new site looks a lot better. Only two key colors aside from black and white, and there’s a new logo (maybe others made comments about the previous one), and less clutter overall. I don’t know if it’s intentional, but the logo somewhat mirrors the comment icons (also new). And best of all, no annoying ads (at least for now).
