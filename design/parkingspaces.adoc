I have some issues with the parking at The Cosmopilitan. One is that parking is no longer free (until recently considered a God-given right on the Strip). The other is that I could not figure out how to get out of the garage with a guest key card (save that for another blog). And I always end up in the exit to Las Vegas Boulevard with no stoplight and thus blocked by a stream of pedestrians.

But the available-space parking signs at every intersection in the garage are perfect.

Every parking lot should have these!
