In my quest to remain svelte, or at least not too non-svelte, I was going to cut out cheesecake this year, until I got some Cheesecake Factory coupons. I had some trouble redeeming this one online, until I figured out by “challenge attempt” it meant entering a recognized email address.

This looks like one of those cases where a programmer error message snuck into the UI before a professional writer or UI designer got to it, but it says “Please try again.” so it seems to have been intended as a customer-facing message. Or maybe a backend developer put in the first part and a front-end developer slapped on the second part.

I guess I should just enjoy my cheesecake.
