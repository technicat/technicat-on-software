I’ve mentioned a lot that the App Store is a more polished and smoothly operating machine than Google Play (also, more lucrative, although “lucrative” is a bit of an exaggeration). However, one thing that Google Play does a much better job of is displaying reviews, at least from the developer’s point of view. For example, when you look at HyperBowl on Google Play, you see the nicest reviews:

HyperBowl on the App Store also has a lot of nice reviews, but every time I update the app, you get this:

Same problem with the Mac App Store. I’m in the process of updating HyperBowl there, but it’s tempting not to, because I hate to cover up that one nice review on the front.

But they’re all better than the Amazon Appstore page, which shows “top” reviews but seems to make a point of showing bad reviews. Or maybe it’s just because I got bad reviews. So you could say it’s more customer friendly. Except the web page looks kind of crappy, especially with ads.
