Pirates are the Worst Publishers

I saw a twitter thread a while back criticizing and defending game publishers, and it occured to me —while as a game developer I have plenty of complaints about publishers, I see a lot more criticism of publishers than pirates, yet really, pirates are the worst publishers.

When I google my HyperBowl game, for example, this site shows up fairly high in the rankings.

No credit, no attribution, no links to my web site, a crude description obviously not written by me, plenty of ads which generate revenue none of which goes to me, of course copied from some other site and posted here, no identification of the uploader (I suspect it’s actually the site operators, although they invite others to upload games as long as they have the right to, wink-nudge), no provision for reporting infringing content, and, like participants in the witness protection program, no information about the site owners.

Even the worst publisher is better than this. At the very least, they publish with your permission (well, actually there was that Android app store that eventually became the Opera store…). So when you visit a game portal, consider whether they’re treating developers as partners (like indie sites gamejolt.com and itch.io) or just ripping them off. And if you don’t care, well, don’t complain about publishers.
