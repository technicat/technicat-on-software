I Got Stars in My Long Tail

As much as app developers complain about the race to the bottom of the long tail (to mix trendy metaphors), it’s still better than other self-publishing domains.

I’ve heard from musician friends that my apps are doing way better than their songs on iTunes, and while it’s getting harder to get anyone to pay for apps, it’s not as bad as music consumers blaming musicians for corporate greed if they charge for songs.

And while I have complaints about going through a book publisher (future blog), I have to admit that was more profitable than my own attempt at self-publishing a book on Amazon and the Nook store.

In this situation, you can try to do a better job of marketing, or adjust your criteria for success. I choose the latter. Look: I got five stars!
