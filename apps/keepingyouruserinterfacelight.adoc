Dark mode in iOS 13 was warmly welcomed by many users, but it did mess up some apps, including a couple of mine that would end up with dark text and dark icons on top of dark backgrounds in dark mode.

Apple has plenty of instructions on how to implement dark mode in your app but I had to google around for a quick fix. And the quickest fix is to set UIUserInterfaceStyle to Light in the app’s info.plist.

This just tells iOS to party like it’s iOS 12 and let the app run like there’s no dark mode. In other words, don’t mess with my user interface colors!
