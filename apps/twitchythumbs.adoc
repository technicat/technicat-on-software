I’m not even close to fulfilling my New Year’s resolution to blog daily (I’m not sure I made that resolution, but I meant to — oh, that’s not a good start). In my defense, it’s hard to think of something to complain about every day. I’m such a cheery person. But as they say, if you can’t think of something not nice to say, say something at all. Or something like that.

So, intermittently, I expect, I’ll just show some stuff from friends, colleagues, and random people I’ve met. Here’s a video from Jim Buck of Twitchy Thumbs, who I almost met at an Appy Hour meetup in San Diego and sort of met on the San Diego IGDA Facebook group. Turns out we’re from the same generatino of OpenGL programmers back when SGI created it and Microsoft adopted it, and Jim remembered the 3D content creation product I worked on (anyone who remembers Nworld/Mirai/Nendo is my instant newest best friend).
