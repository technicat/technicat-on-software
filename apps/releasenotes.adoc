I don’t do auto-updates, if I can help it, so I actually see the release notes on the App Store, at least that first brief snippet. And sometimes I look at an app’s version history to see how often they’re updating it, and as a reference for my own app development and release note writing.

The one that caught my eye just this morning was Memrise. They update frequently and have jovial release notes.

Medium was always a font of creative writing. They seemed to have calmed down a bit, but still drop in an occasional rhyme.
