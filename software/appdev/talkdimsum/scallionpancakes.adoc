Scallion Pancakes

Now that I can’t make my periodic dim sum outings to augment my Talk Dim Sum app, I’m reduced to actually just talking about dim sum.

So today I’ll mention scallion pancakes, a thin pan-fried flatbread made with oil and scallions (green onions). It’s a common Chinese restaurant item and street food. I’ve had scallion pancakes at a couple of places in Las Vegas, most recently from my neighborhood Every Grain.

And also at China Mama in Chinatown.

I don’t know if anyone’s serving them curbside these days, but scallion pancakes make for a convenient takeout item, like when I was driving back from San Diego and stopped by China Republic in Rancho Cucamonga (apparently the only dim sum in San Bernadino County).

And you might consider avoiding the long lines at Costco and go to an Asian supermarket instead, stock up on scallion pancakes in the frozen section.

They’re easy to prep, just pan-fry straight out of the freezer for a few minutes. I’ve been frying them for breakfast almost every day the past couple of weeks!

The Chinese name 蔥油餅 (chūng yòuh béng in Cantonese, cung1 jau4 beng2 in Mandarin) is literally “scallion oil pancake” which pretty much describes the whole ingredient list. If you have flour, oil, and scallions you can make your own from scratch. There are plenty of recipes online: most of them involve mixing a couple of cups of flour with 3/4 cup of water, kneading it into dough, divvying it up into four balls, flattening them out into pancakes, adding oil and scallions into the middle (some have the oil added earlier), rolling them into tubes and then curling them up like snails and flattening them out again before frying.

Or you can try a simplified recipe for people like me and just mix everying together and fry it. When I was a kid in San Bernadino County, my mom made a facsimile by frying up tortillas with scallions sandwiched in them (I guess San Bernadino County had zero dim sum places back then). It was years before I had the real thing, so that was a surprise. But I might try to recreate my mom’s tortilla version. It could be the latest fusion food!
