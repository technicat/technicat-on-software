I started watching the WWDC keynote on my Apple TV, and I stopped after seeing the APPOCALYPSE.

My first reaction was the same one I often get while watching TV – wow, this show is really white, whiter than reality. My second reaction was, I think it’s supposed to funny, but it isn’t. And then I watched it again, and yup, still white, especially if you’re counting everyone with speaking lines who’s speaking English. And this is why WWDC is not the World Wide Diversity Conference.
