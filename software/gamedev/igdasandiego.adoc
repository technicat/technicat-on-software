I was pleasantly surprised to find an active IGDA chapter operating in downtown San Diego (immediate proof of their usefulness can be found on their web site — jobs!). In fact, they regularly meet in the New School of Architecture close by my apartment, including this holiday party+presentation, talk given by Elina Ollila of UX Fit.

Pizza and beer was served (San Diego being craft brew central, there’s always good beer). And games, of course.
