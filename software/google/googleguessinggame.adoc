One thing about Google’s ToS change announcements, they have cute artwork.

But the user-friendliness ends there. Although they invite you to “see what’s changed” they’re doing that weasely corporate lawyer thing where they give pages of legalese without telling you what’s changed (which I suppose is at least better than the game studio that changed my contract without telling me just before giving it to me to sign).

So really, the announcement should read “take a look and guess what’s changed.”
