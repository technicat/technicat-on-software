I had to google the definition of “escheat” but it’s not hard to understand that google is saying they’re going to hand over my $.70 unpaid app income to the US government.

The question is why, as I do have payment information set up and have received payments in the past. The distant past. The problem, apparently, is that they have a one dollar payout minimum, so that $.70 has been sitting there for several years, after I unpublished my sole paid app on Google Play (piracy, low sales, annoying reviews, and unexplained update rejections…) and stopped serving google ads (some of those ads are so awful it’s like having an oil slick spill over your app).

So, they’re threatening to take my money because they haven’t paid me. I tried contacting google to explain their mistake, but their customer support link put me into a circular series of links, interspersed with an occasional “Is this helpful?” query. The answer is no.

In the meantime, their talk of handing over “abandoned assets” is making me nervous, so, as if foretold by prophecy in the form of email, I removed my payment information. Way to go, google.
