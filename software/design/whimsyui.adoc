Whimsy UI

I like a little whimsy in my interfaces. It doesn’t require a lot of fancy visual work (like the animated transitions Apple exhorts for their “delightful” apps). Just choosing the right text will liven up a user experience.

For example, during the obligatory “why are you closing this account” on my bank website, I was presented with a list of options.

“Not Telling” is more fun than, for example, “Prefer Not To Say”, especially since it’s the option I was selecting. In fact, it’s reminiscent of games in which you choose lines of dialogue for your character.

If you’re curious which bank I was using, well…not telling.
