I was looking around for the upload button in YouTube and for several minutes I couldn’t find it.

Eventually I figured out it’s the video camera button icon, which gives you two options: “go live” or upload. I guess the + is supposed indicate the upload option, which is an interesting new icon design strategy: let’s take two standard icons and glom them together! It also doesn’t help that it’s the least prominent button (smallest and in the middle of the action).

I first clicked on the chat balloon with the arrow on it out of desparation (I thought it was a share button, but it’s a Messages button), and later I clicked on the grid button because I figured might as well see what all these mystery buttons do (I thought that would be a grid layout button but it just displays links to YouTube Studio, etc.)

But at least I still recognize the notifications button!
