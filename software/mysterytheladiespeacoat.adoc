I walked out of the Walgreens before realizing my receipt showed that I paid for a peacoat. Two mysteries: what’s a peacoat, and why was it on my receipt?

I solved the first one by googling my way to the wikipedia entry, and my first dubious theory was that somehow they scanned the coat I was wearing. But more googling revealed an LDS PEACOAT is a ladies peacoat.

Then I looked at the rest of the receipt and realized I got charged for only one of two packs of cotton balls, and the product numbers differ in only two digits.

So it looks like the bar code scanner misread two digits of the cotton ball code and came up with peacoat. And by the way, that looks like a pretty good price for a peacoat, setting aside that it’s not a product Walgreens carries.

Lesson learned: check your receipts!
