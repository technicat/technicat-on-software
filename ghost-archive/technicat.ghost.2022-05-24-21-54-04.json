Stupidity is contagious.\"]]]],\"ghostVersion\":\"3.0\"}","html":"<p><em>My first somewhat popular essay on software development, written almost twenty years ago, but I don't think anything has changed.</em></p><p>As a software engineer, you might want any number of things out of your job - a steady paycheck, the opportunity to work on interesting projects, a springboard to the next better job, or maybe you just like hanging out with other programmers. But by \"effective\", I mean the ability to complete projects in a timely manner with the expected quality. After working on dozens of software releases, I believe the following practices will bring you there, and while they may involve sticking your neck out, I’d like to think they will also advance your professional reputation, career longevity, and personal satisfaction.</p><h2 id=\"understand-your-requirements\">Understand Your Requirements</h2><p>The first step in becoming an effective programmer is to ensure that you are spending your time wisely. And there is no greater waste of time than in working on something that is not useful or never shipped.</p><h3 id=\"build-early\">Build Early</h3><p>Get a demonstrable system working as early as possible. This means establishing the interface first, whether it’s an API or user interface, and stubbing the encapsulated functionality as necessary. This allows your \"customers\" to check it out, by exercising the user interface or writing code to the API, and any inconsistencies or omissions in the initial spec can be detected early. Chances are, you will notice problems or potential improvements even before releasing this first deliverable.</p><p>There is a classical school of thought that believes if you design everything up front, then all you have to do is write the code and you’re done. That works great if you’ve done the exact same project before. Otherwise, it’s more likely you’ll run into a point where you’re just guessing or operating on questionable assumptions.</p><blockquote>Upon joining an early-stage wireless internet startup, I found myself in two months of design meetings for a wireless portal and gateway due to launch in six months. Eventually we got tired of meeting and finally started coding. Within two weeks, my part of the project had no resemblance to the original design, and the first wireless connection test two months later revealed a fundamental misunderstanding of the wireless protocol.</blockquote><p>This is not to say that design is unnecessary. But after a certain point, design is just speculation. Design should be validated with implementation, and better to do that early and continuously than late and, well, too late.</p><p>Even if the original design is sufficient, once you have something you can tweak, you can improve upon it. Hardware products (who designed this VCR?), buildings, and large-scale software projects suffer from interfaces that were frozen in \"preproduction\", but with software, you have an opportunity early in the project to refine your understanding of the requirements and produce a suitable interface. But it must be done early.</p><p>Getting something ready early is also good for your occupational well-being. Your boss will appreciate seeing evidence that something is actually getting done and having something available to demo. On the other hand, a drawn out period with nothing to show is a recipe for anxious management.</p><h3 id=\"deliver-often\">Deliver Often</h3><p>Once you have something working, don’t just leave it as a \"proof of concept\". Let people play with it, see their reactions, and let this guide and prioritize your development. There is no substitute for watching how people use your software. Customer questionnaires and focus studies might provide some useful input but run the risk of transferring feature and design decisions from the developer to the customer.</p><p>In particular get the software into the hands of the QA staff as soon as possible and feed them regular builds, preferably at scheduled intervals. Having them test automated daily builds is ideal, but even a weekly build is pretty good. This will help them feel involved in the full life-cycle of the project and they should be best-trained at identifying and reporting problems. The highest priority should be given to issues that prevent them from using the product, e.g. crashes or dead-end paths - you want them to cover as much as possible as soon as possible and get a feel for the whole product so design issues can be identified early.</p><blockquote>At a small 3D graphics software vendor, I was put in charge of porting the flagship product from SGI workstations to Windows NT. After six months, the port was so incomplete and crash-prone that I was reluctant to give the first \"alpha\" build our test group. Fortunately, the QA manager insisted, and the resulting bombardment of bug reports forced me to immediately focus on the problems that prevented the testers from exercising the application in any meaningful way. Left to my own devices, I would have worked on what seemed to be the harder and more important core 3D issues, and probably delayed too long on seemingly mundane issues like the user interface, load-save functionality, and compatibility with all the varieties of consumer hardware we were planning to support.</blockquote><p>Programmers often don’t want to release code to testers early - they don’t want to hear about a bunch of bugs they already know about, and quite possibly the testers don’t want to test something that barely works. But it’s the testers' job to find these problems and programmers need to realize bug reports are a good thing, if they arrive early enough.</p><h2 id=\"keep-it-real\">Keep It Real</h2><p>Keep your software running in as close to a shipping state as possible. You never know when you’ll have to demo the system, send out an evaluation copy, or even deliver (\"OK, time to wrap things up!\")</p><h3 id=\"use-real-data\">Use Real Data</h3><p>If you just test with sample data, that big iceberg of real data out there is going to sink your program.</p><blockquote>One of the leading semiconductor fabs evaluated a supply chain management product I was working on. After crunching out a milestone delivery to them, we got word back that the first batch of data they fed it from their own operations was still processing - for two days. I sympathized with the lead programmer, who had to dig down and emergency-optimized everything he could for two weeks with both management and client breathing down his neck. I’m just glad it wasn’t me on the line.</blockquote><h3 id=\"use-real-builds\">Use Real Builds</h3><p>Remember the development build on your machine is not the real build.</p><blockquote>On a game development project where I worked on the user interface, I got intermittent reports from QA that some colors were not correct. Eventually, I realized the problem only showed up in release builds and another programmer used the special console debugging hardware to track down the bug. Which turned out to be a silly mistake I’d made two months previous, failing to specify an initial color value in a few cases. The debug build always selected a specific default value, while the release build optimized that away and the result was less determinate. If I’d made a point of running the release build frequently, I would have spotted my mistake immediately, instead of losing it in the sands of time.</blockquote><h3 id=\"merge-often\">Merge Often</h3><p>Don’t procrastinate on merging your code with the main code base - the longer you wait, the harder it gets.</p><blockquote>I worked with a programmer who \"couldn’t be bothered with\" all the new code and data changes that showed up in the repository every day. And certainly, daily merges did take up some time for all the other programmers, and this programmer was able to run some impressive standalone demos with a snapshot of the code and data. But every time we had a milestone delivery, it took days to get the isolated code reattached to the current codebase again, sometimes compromising the milestone delivery and risking the funding for the entire project.</blockquote><p>Keeping your code out of the official build means that programmers cannot evaluate your code and testers cannot spot bugs early. Maybe you don’t want people picking on your code or bugs, but it’s better to identify those issues early than later - suck it up.</p><h2 id=\"understand-your-code\">Understand Your Code</h2><p>Life is full of wonderful mysteries, but your code is not the place for them. You don’t have to know how your car works - if the engine starts making strange noises, you drop it off the mechanic. When it comes to your code, if you don’t understand how it works, or doesn’t work, no one will.</p><h3 id=\"code-with-style\">Code with Style</h3><p>My childhood piano teacher once commented to me, \"Your sister has a good sense of timing, and your brother has a good feel of the keyboard.\" Then he paused. \"You, uh, you work hard.\"</p><p>Programming is one of those things that a lot of people are more or less competent at, but some in particular have a flair for it. I’m a lousy piano player despite years of lessons, and I’m a mediocre basketball player although I enjoy playing it immensely. But I do like to think I have a flair for programming and writing. And not surprisingly, I think good programming is like good writing. Both prose and code are textual, have grammar, syntax, spelling and semantics and spelling. For most coders and writers, this is enough, but the best writers and coders have an esthetic and their work features structure and style that can often be identified with the author.</p><p>Many Windows programmers wonder why grumpy old Unix/Mac/Amiga/Lisp programmers rail against Win32/MFC/.NET, but if all the API’s you’ve seen are from Microsoft, you probably don’t know there’s anything better.</p><p>Perhaps not everyone is capable of writing stylish code - I’ve heard it said that good object-oriented programmers, in particular, are born and not made. But like fine music, wine, and literature, you can learn to appreciate good code.</p><h3 id=\"cut-and-paste\">Cut-and-Paste</h3><p>The opposite of stylish programming is cut-and-paste. Grab some code from somewhere that is supposed to do something like what you want, tweak it until it sort of works, stir, repeat, and voila, you have the software equivalent of mystery meat.</p><blockquote>A few months after leaving one company, a former coworker emailed me a single function consisting of ten pages of cut-and-paste code and asked why it wasn’t working. I could have very well asked why it should work at all. If you can’t explain how your own code is supposed to work, how can you expect anyone to help you with it? (He has since moved on to a management position at Microsoft)</blockquote><p>I’ve even had trouble diagnosing my own code that was cut-and-pasted from sample code. It’s a reasonable way to start new code, but you can’t just leave it alone when it seems to work - you have to go back and make sure you understand it line by line and clean it up for your own purposes.</p><h3 id=\"keep-it-clean\">Keep it Clean</h3><p>The key to keeping your house/condo/apartment clean is to spend a little time cleaning it every day, or at least every week. If you wait until your abode is an unsightly mess, it’s just too much damn trouble to clean it all up and you end up just doing a halfhearted job. Or your hire a cleaning service.</p><p>Assuming you don’t have the luxury of hiring someone to come in and clean up your code every week, you should periodically inspect your code, sweep up accumulated hard-coded numbers, outdated comments, misleading function names, or you’ll inevitably end up with uninhabitable code that’s embarrassing to show anyone else. And if you’re not embarrassed, well, you should be.</p><blockquote>One programmer I supervised kept reporting to me that her code was \"done\". This is what management normally likes to hear, but it drives me crazy. Code is never done - you have to debug it, maintain it, evolve it until it’s put out to pasture.</blockquote><h3 id=\"questions-comments\">Questions? Comments?</h3><p>Some like to think of programming as a craft. Others, engineering. More often than not, it’s archaeology. You dig through sediments of code and wonder what purpose all these strange artifacts served. Do future generations a favor and leave some clues.</p><blockquote>I asked the aforementioned engineer whose code was \"done\" to add comments. The result, a function named GetData was prefaced by the comment \"Gets data.\" That’s not just useless - it’s insulting. What data? (factory automation schedules) In what format? (a proprietary XML format) From where? (an in-house server, using TCP/IP) Not to mention little details like what happens when the server is unavailable or the transmission is broken.</blockquote><p>Document your code as if someone else might have to take it over at any moment and know what to do with it. That person might actually be you - how often have you had to revisit your own code and thought to yourself, what was I trying to do here?</p><blockquote>On a contract with a previous employer, I was asked to look over a piece of code that no one else had time to attend to. At first, I thought it was a mess and didn’t know what was going on in there. Then I gradually figured out what the code was doing, and I grudgingly admitted the code wasn’t too bad. And then I eventually realized that I had written the code two years ago. Note to self: need more comments.</blockquote><p>With that in mind, annotate your code as you write it, instead of waiting for a convenient cleanup phase in \"post\" - annotating as you code can even clarify your thoughts while you’re programming. You can be your own pair-programming buddy.</p><p>As a bonus, these days you can generate nice HTML or otherwise-formatted documentation from source code comments, using javadoc, doxygen, whatever. Ideally, the doc-generation is part of your nightly build and available via your intranet.</p><h3 id=\"full-warning\">Full Warning</h3><p>Ignore compiler and runtime warnings at your own peril. They are called \"warnings\" for a reason. I shipped one Unix-based application that had a problem linking some functions successfully - we worked around it by relinking those functions at runtime. When we performed a clean rebuild six months later for the next release, it was revealed that we had turned off linker warnings which would have alerted us of a known linker bug. In our defense, we had swept the linker problems under the carpet at the Unix vendor’s suggestion, (thanks, SGI!) but it turned out we could get the link to work just by reordering our libraries.</p><p>Crank up the warning levels on your compilers, sprinkle your code with assertions, and log the build and test-time warnings. Better yet, include a count of those warnings in your build metrics so you know if you’re dealing with them or letting them accumulate.</p><h2 id=\"optimal-programming\">Optimal Programming</h2><h3 id=\"code-with-purpose\">Code with Purpose</h3><p>On the other extreme from cut-and-pasters are those who change code just to make it look prettier (at least to them). While it’s laudable to have a programming esthetic, it’s a waste of time (and a useless risk) to change code just so it looks better to you. It’s aggressively annoying to go through and change code that other people have written just so it looks better to you.</p><blockquote>A fastidious coworker of mine went through our codebase and removed all the expletives. Probably no one would have complained if he had just cleaned up the code written by the entry level employees, but the expletives belonged to the technical lead of our group who was also one of the few distinguished Fellows at the company.</blockquote><h3 id=\"do-no-harm\">Do No Harm</h3><p>\"Refactoring\" is all the rage, now, but programmers often take it to mean any code cleanup or redesign. The trick is in reorganizing code for the better without breaking anything. If you break existing functionality in the name of progress, you’re sending one of two messages: 1) your time is more important than everyone else’s, or 2) you’re incapable of touching code without breaking it.</p><blockquote>I had one particularly contentious coworker who decided to reimplement the parser in our system but left the code in an unbuildable state by everyone else. I asked him to revert his changes and then found the code was buildable but not runnable - asked about it, he replied that he removed the parser entirely \"per your request\". Not a team player.</blockquote><p>Keeping the code functioning takes some patience and extra work - you have to be diligent about regression-testing your work and chances are you’ll need to keep old code and interfaces around for a while as you migrate functionality to your new code. But for everyone to work with the same codebase, that’s what you have to do.</p><h3 id=\"find-the-bottleneck\">Find the Bottleneck</h3><p>People always talk about \"optimization\", but that isn’t really a correct word. We’re rarely shooting for the optimum - instead, we make improvements and tradeoffs to achieve good-enough performance.</p><blockquote>I was asked in a phone interview with Google how I would search for a number in an array of ordered numbers. Obviously, the questioner was asking for a CS 101 answer - binary search. But in real life, I would probably do the \"wrong\" thing - search the array from beginning to end. There’s no point in taking twice the time to write twice as much code that has to be maintained and debugged if the application performance is good enough, and in particular if that piece of code is not the bottleneck in the application. (And I seriously doubt you’d have that data laid out linearly in a fixed array like that if it was the bottleneck)</blockquote><p>If you do need to optimize for speed or space in you application, attacking anything other than the bottleneck is a waste of time.</p><h2 id=\"manage-thyself\">Manage Thyself</h2><p>You probably have a lot of complaints about your boss being a lousy manager, and you’re probably right. So you have to be your own manager. Even if you have a decent boss, he’s not going to stand behind you telling you what to type and how fast (although I’m sure many would like to).</p><h3 id=\"are-we-there-yet\">Are We There, Yet?</h3><p>Programmers are notoriously inadequate at providing useful schedule estimates. I think this is a bad rap, since management, left to their own devices, often make even worse predictions, and unwelcome news from engineers is often ignored. (A common theme in any engineering disaster). But still, awareness of the schedule is critical to actually getting the project done on time.</p><p>On one commercial software project, some of my coworkers were blissfully unaware of the product release date - one inquired whether it had been released already, another was surprised to find it was going out in a few days.</p><p>The worst, and most common, schedule estimate that a programmer can give is \"it should just take a couple of days\". Every time I hear that, even from my own mouth, I wince.</p><blockquote>The president of a graphics software company really wanted support for VRML (at the time it was the Next Big Thing) included in the product we were releasing in two months. He probably figured (correctly) that I would resist starting a new feature, so he went to another engineer and got the answer he wanted: \"a couple of days\". Two days later, I told the president we-just-wasted-two-days-of-his-time-and-mine-while-there-are-two-hundred-high-priority-bugs-to-fix, which he found to be a persuasive argument. (postscript: VRML didn’t exactly take off like gangbusters)</blockquote><p>And then there are programmers who are unable to come up with time estimates at all. But there’s no need to get thrown off by the fuzzy nature of the request - it is an estimate after all, and in fact you should avoid using formulas. If you’re an experienced engineer, you know how long comparable tasks have taken you before, and if you’re not experienced, you can ask someone who is.</p><blockquote>A smart friend of mine who was often assigned to developing experimental prototypes asked me, \"how can you schedule research\". I think it was a rhetorical question, but even pure researchers have schedules. Someone is paying them and expects results, even if it’s a number of demos or published papers in a certain timespan. And if you really don’t have the foggiest idea how long something will take, then you’re the wrong person for the task.</blockquote><p>Sometimes programmers are reluctant to commit to a schedule because they’re afraid of the accountability. It is true, in this imperfect world, managers will try to bargain you down on schedules, political factions may saddle you with tough or unrealistic schedules in the hopes that you will fail, and it is a sadly common story that after you commit to a schedule, you don’t get everything you need.</p><blockquote>I had one boss who after asking for an estimated completion time would say, \"do you promise?\" But ask for a commitment on the required hardware and other dependencies, and it was \"I’ll try.\"</blockquote><p>All I can say is, stick to your guns and give a realistic prediction. Any concessions should be based on pragmatic tradeoffs between features and resources. Be clear about the assumptions, dependencies and resources on which the schedule is based, and get it written down somewhere so you can jog defective memories later.</p><h3 id=\"plan-your-progress\">Plan Your Progress</h3><p>You wouldn’t just hop into your car before deciding where you want to go, right? And probably you have a route in mind before you start driving, too. Similarly, before you sit down at our computer, you should know what you want to accomplish that day and have some idea how.</p><p>Distractions will come up day-to-day, so you won’t always be able to accomplish what you want. And contrary to those who treat software engineering groups as vending machines (they would probably shake us vigorously if they could) some tasks take more than a day. So think about what you want to accomplish by Friday, and if you do, then you can enjoy the weekend that much more.</p><h2 id=\"continuous-education\">Continuous Education</h2><p>A corporate soccer team member once asked me, as we were lacing up our cleats, \"what’s the secret to C programming?\" If there was such a secret, I’d be hawking it on late night TV along with ab machines and how to get rich in real estate. Sorry, there’s no shortcut - you have to learn and practice and make some mistakes. And you don’t necessarily have to rely on corporate training or going back to school - there are plenty of (inter)national and local professional groups, books, and of course, the Internet.</p><h3 id=\"it-s-science\">It’s Science</h3><p>It’s called \"computer science\" for a reason. It’s easy (maybe too easy) for anyone to to start programming, without a formal computer science education. In particular, those from other engineering and science disciplines can pick up programming quickly and make a good living. But to effectively tackle non-trivial tasks, you need to know the inherent capabilities and limitations of software and recognize prior work, so you don’t waste time reinventing the wheel, badly. You don’t have to know everything under the sun, but you should have at least a cursory familiarity with many areas and be prepared to do some additional research as necessary.</p><p>For example, anyone who creates a new file format should know something about compilers. I don’t mean all the code-generation optimizations like loop unrolling, but the basic issues and various phases of compilation and most of all the importance of specifying the tokenization and grammar. Nowadays, most people by default will use XML, and that’s a good thing, but before then it was typical to cobble up some text format, point to some generated sample files as documentation, and then everyone else who wrote another parser would cobble something up that would read in some files but not all. In the problematic cases then you could point fingers either way - either the reader is bad or the writer is bad. Whichever product is more popular wins.</p><blockquote>One of my pet peeves with the 3D graphics industry is the plethora of ill-defined file formats. When I implemented an OBJ file parser for a 3D content creation product, each exporting product that I tested against generated markedly different files, using different whitespace and newline conventions, for example. In refreshing contrast, a coworker of mine fresh out of school designed a new game interchange format using a grammar and lexer specification. (These days, it’s not much of an issue anymore - most new graphics file formats seem to be based on XML.)</blockquote><p>And if anything differentiates programmers who can just put together simple scripts and user interfaces and those who can tackle real problems, it’s an understanding of computational complexity, i.e. how algorithms scale with the size of the problem. Every programmer should know basic complexity terminology and have a general knowledge of the complexity of common problems.</p><p>My first job was in computer-aided semiconductor design, which has a lot scalability issues, including some NP-complete (essentially intractable) problems. But some of the engineers would run around excitedly saying \"it’s the traveling salesman problem!\" every time they saw a problem that couldn’t be solved in linear time, and in other cases we boasted of \"linear-time\" algorithms which probably meant linear-time most-of-the-time. Or some of the time.</p><h3 id=\"free-beer-free-speech-free-software\">Free Beer, Free Speech, Free Software</h3><p>OK, there’s no free beer, but this is a good time to be a programmer (well, recession and outsourcing controversy notwithstanding) - just about everything you need is on the Internet tutorials, discussion lists, and free software. All you need is the hardware and a broadband connection.</p><h2 id=\"r-e-s-p-e-c-t\">R-E-S-P-E-C-T</h2><p>One requirement for being an effective software engineer is to be taken seriously. You need to have the respect of your peers and managers, at least for your technical capabilities, to have control over your own work and influence over others.</p><h3 id=\"there-is-such-a-thing-as-a-stupid-question\">There is Such a Thing as a Stupid Question</h3><p>Really, there are lots of stupid questions. Asking intelligent questions that enhance others' respect for you is a professional skill. A good question that exposes unresolved issues tells people that you know your stuff and you’re sharp enough to catch all the implications. Asking for clarification about a specification shows you know how to find and read the spec and your ability to detect ambiguities.</p><p>If you don’t get any answers to your question, chances are there’s something wrong with the question, so don’t just repeat it. Ask the question differently, with more specifics, or more background.

But by \"effective\", I mean the ability to complete projects in a\ntimely manner with the expected quality. After working on dozens of software\nreleases, I believe the following practices will bring you there, and while they\nmay involve sticking your neck out, I’d like to think they will also advance\nyour professional reputation, career longevity, and personal satisfaction.\n\nUnderstand Your Requirements\nThe first step in becoming an effective programmer is to ensure that you are\nspending your time wisely. And there is no greater waste of time than in working\non something that is not useful or never shipped.\n\nBuild Early\nGet a demonstrable system working as early as possible. This means establishing\nthe interface first, whether it’s an API or user interface, and stubbing the\nencapsulated functionality as necessary. This allows your \"customers\" to check\nit out, by exercising the user interface or writing code to the API, and any\ninconsistencies or omissions in the initial spec can be detected early. Chances\nare, you will notice problems or potential improvements even before releasing\nthis first deliverable.\n\nThere is a classical school of thought that believes if you design everything up\nfront, then all you have to do is write the code and you’re done. That works\ngreat if you’ve done the exact same project before. Otherwise, it’s more likely\nyou’ll run into a point where you’re just guessing or operating on questionable\nassumptions.\n\n> Upon joining an early-stage wireless internet startup, I found myself in two\nmonths of design meetings for a wireless portal and gateway due to launch in six\nmonths. Eventually we got tired of meeting and finally started coding. Within\ntwo weeks, my part of the project had no resemblance to the original design, and\nthe first wireless connection test two months later revealed a fundamental\nmisunderstanding of the wireless protocol.\nThis is not to say that design is unnecessary. But after a certain point, design\nis just speculation. Design should be validated with implementation, and better\nto do that early and continuously than late and, well, too late.\n\nEven if the original design is sufficient, once you have something you can\ntweak, you can improve upon it. Hardware products (who designed this VCR?),\nbuildings, and large-scale software projects suffer from interfaces that were\nfrozen in \"preproduction\", but with software, you have an opportunity early in\nthe project to refine your understanding of the requirements and produce a\nsuitable interface. But it must be done early.\n\nGetting something ready early is also good for your occupational well-being.\nYour boss will appreciate seeing evidence that something is actually getting\ndone and having something available to demo. On the other hand, a drawn out\nperiod with nothing to show is a recipe for anxious management.\n\nDeliver Often\nOnce you have something working, don’t just leave it as a \"proof of concept\".\nLet people play with it, see their reactions, and let this guide and prioritize\nyour development. There is no substitute for watching how people use your\nsoftware. Customer questionnaires and focus studies might provide some useful\ninput but run the risk of transferring feature and design decisions from the\ndeveloper to the customer.\n\nIn particular get the software into the hands of the QA staff as soon as\npossible and feed them regular builds, preferably at scheduled intervals. Having\nthem test automated daily builds is ideal, but even a weekly build is pretty\ngood. This will help them feel involved in the full life-cycle of the project\nand they should be best-trained at identifying and reporting problems. The\nhighest priority should be given to issues that prevent them from using the\nproduct, e.g. crashes or dead-end paths - you want them to cover as much as\npossible as soon as possible and get a feel for the whole product so design\nissues can be identified early.\n\n> At a small 3D graphics software vendor, I was put in charge of porting the\nflagship product from SGI workstations to Windows NT. After six months, the port\nwas so incomplete and crash-prone that I was reluctant to give the first \"alpha\"\nbuild our test group. Fortunately, the QA manager insisted, and the resulting\nbombardment of bug reports forced me to immediately focus on the problems that\nprevented the testers from exercising the application in any meaningful way.\nLeft to my own devices, I would have worked on what seemed to be the harder and\nmore important core 3D issues, and probably delayed too long on seemingly\nmundane issues like the user interface, load-save functionality, and\ncompatibility with all the varieties of consumer hardware we were planning to\nsupport.\nProgrammers often don’t want to release code to testers early - they don’t want\nto hear about a bunch of bugs they already know about, and quite possibly the\ntesters don’t want to test something that barely works. But it’s the testers'\njob to find these problems and programmers need to realize bug reports are a\ngood thing, if they arrive early enough.\n\nKeep It Real\nKeep your software running in as close to a shipping state as possible. You\nnever know when you’ll have to demo the system, send out an evaluation copy, or\neven deliver (\"OK, time to wrap things up!\")\n\nUse Real Data\nIf you just test with sample data, that big iceberg of real data out there is\ngoing to sink your program.\n\n> One of the leading semiconductor fabs evaluated a supply chain management\nproduct I was working on. After crunching out a milestone delivery to them, we\ngot word back that the first batch of data they fed it from their own operations\nwas still processing - for two days. I sympathized with the lead programmer, who\nhad to dig down and emergency-optimized everything he could for two weeks with\nboth management and client breathing down his neck. I’m just glad it wasn’t me\non the line.\nUse Real Builds\nRemember the development build on your machine is not the real build.\n\n> On a game development project where I worked on the user interface, I got\nintermittent reports from QA that some colors were not correct. Eventually, I\nrealized the problem only showed up in release builds and another programmer\nused the special console debugging hardware to track down the bug. Which turned\nout to be a silly mistake I’d made two months previous, failing to specify an\ninitial color value in a few cases. The debug build always selected a specific\ndefault value, while the release build optimized that away and the result was\nless determinate. If I’d made a point of running the release build frequently, I\nwould have spotted my mistake immediately, instead of losing it in the sands of\ntime.\nMerge Often\nDon’t procrastinate on merging your code with the main code base - the longer\nyou wait, the harder it gets.\n\n> I worked with a programmer who \"couldn’t be bothered with\" all the new code and\ndata changes that showed up in the repository every day. And certainly, daily\nmerges did take up some time for all the other programmers, and this programmer\nwas able to run some impressive standalone demos with a snapshot of the code and\ndata. But every time we had a milestone delivery, it took days to get the\nisolated code reattached to the current codebase again, sometimes compromising\nthe milestone delivery and risking the funding for the entire project.\nKeeping your code out of the official build means that programmers cannot\nevaluate your code and testers cannot spot bugs early. Maybe you don’t want\npeople picking on your code or bugs, but it’s better to identify those issues\nearly than later - suck it up.\n\nUnderstand Your Code\nLife is full of wonderful mysteries, but your code is not the place for them.\nYou don’t have to know how your car works - if the engine starts making strange\nnoises, you drop it off the mechanic. When it comes to your code, if you don’t\nunderstand how it works, or doesn’t work, no one will.\n\nCode with Style\nMy childhood piano teacher once commented to me, \"Your sister has a good sense\nof timing, and your brother has a good feel of the keyboard.\" Then he paused.\n\"You, uh, you work hard.\"\n\nProgramming is one of those things that a lot of people are more or less\ncompetent at, but some in particular have a flair for it. I’m a lousy piano\nplayer despite years of lessons, and I’m a mediocre basketball player although I\nenjoy playing it immensely. But I do like to think I have a flair for\nprogramming and writing. And not surprisingly, I think good programming is like\ngood writing. Both prose and code are textual, have grammar, syntax, spelling\nand semantics and spelling. For most coders and writers, this is enough, but the\nbest writers and coders have an esthetic and their work features structure and\nstyle that can often be identified with the author.\n\nMany Windows programmers wonder why grumpy old Unix/Mac/Amiga/Lisp programmers\nrail against Win32/MFC/.NET, but if all the API’s you’ve seen are from\nMicrosoft, you probably don’t know there’s anything better.\n\nPerhaps not everyone is capable of writing stylish code - I’ve heard it said\nthat good object-oriented programmers, in particular, are born and not made. But\nlike fine music, wine, and literature, you can learn to appreciate good code.\n\nCut-and-Paste\nThe opposite of stylish programming is cut-and-paste. Grab some code from\nsomewhere that is supposed to do something like what you want, tweak it until it\nsort of works, stir, repeat, and voila, you have the software equivalent of\nmystery meat.\n\n> A few months after leaving one company, a former coworker emailed me a single\nfunction consisting of ten pages of cut-and-paste code and asked why it wasn’t\nworking. I could have very well asked why it should work at all. If you can’t\nexplain how your own code is supposed to work, how can you expect anyone to help\nyou with it? (He has since moved on to a management position at Microsoft)\nI’ve even had trouble diagnosing my own code that was cut-and-pasted from sample\ncode. It’s a reasonable way to start new code, but you can’t just leave it alone\nwhen it seems to work - you have to go back and make sure you understand it line\nby line and clean it up for your own purposes.\n\nKeep it Clean\nThe key to keeping your house/condo/apartment clean is to spend a little time\ncleaning it every day, or at least every week. If you wait until your abode is\nan unsightly mess, it’s just too much damn trouble to clean it all up and you\nend up just doing a halfhearted job. Or your hire a cleaning service.\n\nAssuming you don’t have the luxury of hiring someone to come in and clean up\nyour code every week, you should periodically inspect your code, sweep up\naccumulated hard-coded numbers, outdated comments, misleading function names, or\nyou’ll inevitably end up with uninhabitable code that’s embarrassing to show\nanyone else. And if you’re not embarrassed, well, you should be.\n\n> One programmer I supervised kept reporting to me that her code was \"done\". This\nis what management normally likes to hear, but it drives me crazy. Code is never\ndone - you have to debug it, maintain it, evolve it until it’s put out to\npasture.\nQuestions? Comments?\nSome like to think of programming as a craft. Others, engineering. More often\nthan not, it’s archaeology. You dig through sediments of code and wonder what\npurpose all these strange artifacts served. Do future generations a favor and\nleave some clues.\n\n> I asked the aforementioned engineer whose code was \"done\" to add comments. The\nresult, a function named GetData was prefaced by the comment \"Gets data.\" That’s\nnot just useless - it’s insulting. What data? (factory automation schedules) In\nwhat format? (a proprietary XML format) From where? (an in-house server, using\nTCP/IP) Not to mention little details like what happens when the server is\nunavailable or the transmission is broken.\nDocument your code as if someone else might have to take it over at any moment\nand know what to do with it. That person might actually be you - how often have\nyou had to revisit your own code and thought to yourself, what was I trying to\ndo here?\n\n> On a contract with a previous employer, I was asked to look over a piece of code\nthat no one else had time to attend to. At first, I thought it was a mess and\ndidn’t know what was going on in there. Then I gradually figured out what the\ncode was doing, and I grudgingly admitted the code wasn’t too bad. And then I\neventually realized that I had written the code two years ago. Note to self:\nneed more comments.\nWith that in mind, annotate your code as you write it, instead of waiting for a\nconvenient cleanup phase in \"post\" - annotating as you code can even clarify\nyour thoughts while you’re programming. You can be your own pair-programming\nbuddy.\n\nAs a bonus, these days you can generate nice HTML or otherwise-formatted\ndocumentation from source code comments, using javadoc, doxygen, whatever.\nIdeally, the doc-generation is part of your nightly build and available via your\nintranet.\n\nFull Warning\nIgnore compiler and runtime warnings at your own peril. They are called\n\"warnings\" for a reason. I shipped one Unix-based application that had a problem\nlinking some functions successfully - we worked around it by relinking those\nfunctions at runtime. When we performed a clean rebuild six months later for the\nnext release, it was revealed that we had turned off linker warnings which would\nhave alerted us of a known linker bug. In our defense, we had swept the linker\nproblems under the carpet at the Unix vendor’s suggestion, (thanks, SGI!) but it\nturned out we could get the link to work just by reordering our libraries.\n\nCrank up the warning levels on your compilers, sprinkle your code with\nassertions, and log the build and test-time warnings. Better yet, include a\ncount of those warnings in your build metrics so you know if you’re dealing with\nthem or letting them accumulate.\n\nOptimal Programming\nCode with Purpose\nOn the other extreme from cut-and-pasters are those who change code just to make\nit look prettier (at least to them). While it’s laudable to have a programming\nesthetic, it’s a waste of time (and a useless risk) to change code just so it\nlooks better to you. It’s aggressively annoying to go through and change code\nthat other people have written just so it looks better to you.\n\n> A fastidious coworker of mine went through our codebase and removed all the\nexpletives. Probably no one would have complained if he had just cleaned up the\ncode written by the entry level employees, but the expletives belonged to the\ntechnical lead of our group who was also one of the few distinguished Fellows at\nthe company.\nDo No Harm\n\"Refactoring\" is all the rage, now, but programmers often take it to mean any\ncode cleanup or redesign. The trick is in reorganizing code for the better\nwithout breaking anything. If you break existing functionality in the name of\nprogress, you’re sending one of two messages: 1) your time is more important\nthan everyone else’s, or 2) you’re incapable of touching code without breaking\nit.\n\n> I had one particularly contentious coworker who decided to reimplement the\nparser in our system but left the code in an unbuildable state by everyone else.\nI asked him to revert his changes and then found the code was buildable but not\nrunnable - asked about it, he replied that he removed the parser entirely \"per\nyour request\". Not a team player.\nKeeping the code functioning takes some patience and extra work - you have to be\ndiligent about regression-testing your work and chances are you’ll need to keep\nold code and interfaces around for a while as you migrate functionality to your\nnew code. But for everyone to work with the same codebase, that’s what you have\nto do.\n\nFind the Bottleneck\nPeople always talk about \"optimization\", but that isn’t really a correct word.\nWe’re rarely shooting for the optimum - instead, we make improvements and\ntradeoffs to achieve good-enough performance.\n\n> I was asked in a phone interview with Google how I would search for a number in\nan array of ordered numbers. Obviously, the questioner was asking for a CS 101\nanswer - binary search. But in real life, I would probably do the \"wrong\" thing\n- search the array from beginning to end. There’s no point in taking twice the\ntime to write twice as much code that has to be maintained and debugged if the\napplication performance is good enough, and in particular if that piece of code\nis not the bottleneck in the application. (And I seriously doubt you’d have that\ndata laid out linearly in a fixed array like that if it was the bottleneck)\nIf you do need to optimize for speed or space in you application, attacking\nanything other than the bottleneck is a waste of time.\n\nManage Thyself\nYou probably have a lot of complaints about your boss being a lousy manager, and\nyou’re probably right. So you have to be your own manager. Even if you have a\ndecent boss, he’s not going to stand behind you telling you what to type and how\nfast (although I’m sure many would like to).\n\nAre We There, Yet?\nProgrammers are notoriously inadequate at providing useful schedule estimates. I\nthink this is a bad rap, since management, left to their own devices, often make\neven worse predictions, and unwelcome news from engineers is often ignored. (A\ncommon theme in any engineering disaster). But still, awareness of the schedule\nis critical to actually getting the project done on time.\n\nOn one commercial software project, some of my coworkers were blissfully unaware\nof the product release date - one inquired whether it had been released already,\nanother was surprised to find it was going out in a few days.\n\nThe worst, and most common, schedule estimate that a programmer can give is \"it\nshould just take a couple of days\". Every time I hear that, even from my own\nmouth, I wince.\n\n> The president of a graphics software company really wanted support for VRML (at\nthe time it was the Next Big Thing) included in the product we were releasing in\ntwo months. He probably figured (correctly) that I would resist starting a new\nfeature, so he went to another engineer and got the answer he wanted: \"a couple\nof days\". Two days later, I told the president\nwe-just-wasted-two-days-of-his-time-and-mine-while-there-are-two-hundred-high-priority-bugs-to-fix,\nwhich he found to be a persuasive argument. (postscript: VRML didn’t exactly\ntake off like gangbusters)\nAnd then there are programmers who are unable to come up with time estimates at\nall. But there’s no need to get thrown off by the fuzzy nature of the request -\nit is an estimate after all, and in fact you should avoid using formulas. If\nyou’re an experienced engineer, you know how long comparable tasks have taken\nyou before, and if you’re not experienced, you can ask someone who is.\n\n> A smart friend of mine who was often assigned to developing experimental\nprototypes asked me, \"how can you schedule research\". I think it was a\nrhetorical question, but even pure researchers have schedules. Someone is paying\nthem and expects results, even if it’s a number of demos or published papers in\na certain timespan. And if you really don’t have the foggiest idea how long\nsomething will take, then you’re the wrong person for the task.\nSometimes programmers are reluctant to commit to a schedule because they’re\nafraid of the accountability. It is true, in this imperfect world, managers will\ntry to bargain you down on schedules, political factions may saddle you with\ntough or unrealistic schedules in the hopes that you will fail, and it is a\nsadly common story that after you commit to a schedule, you don’t get everything\nyou need.\n\n> I had one boss who after asking for an estimated completion time would say, \"do\nyou promise?\" But ask for a commitment on the required hardware and other\ndependencies, and it was \"I’ll try.\"\nAll I can say is, stick to your guns and give a realistic prediction. Any\nconcessions should be based on pragmatic tradeoffs between features and\nresources. Be clear about the assumptions, dependencies and resources on which\nthe schedule is based, and get it written down somewhere so you can jog\ndefective memories later.\n\nPlan Your Progress\nYou wouldn’t just hop into your car before deciding where you want to go, right?\nAnd probably you have a route in mind before you start driving, too. Similarly,\nbefore you sit down at our computer, you should know what you want to accomplish\nthat day and have some idea how.\n\nDistractions will come up day-to-day, so you won’t always be able to accomplish\nwhat you want. And contrary to those who treat software engineering groups as\nvending machines (they would probably shake us vigorously if they could) some\ntasks take more than a day. So think about what you want to accomplish by\nFriday, and if you do, then you can enjoy the weekend that much more.\n\nContinuous Education\nA corporate soccer team member once asked me, as we were lacing up our cleats,\n\"what’s the secret to C programming?\" If there was such a secret, I’d be hawking\nit on late night TV along with ab machines and how to get rich in real estate.\nSorry, there’s no shortcut - you have to learn and practice and make some\nmistakes. And you don’t necessarily have to rely on corporate training or going\nback to school - there are plenty of (inter)national and local professional\ngroups, books, and of course, the Internet.\n\nIt’s Science\nIt’s called \"computer science\" for a reason. It’s easy (maybe too easy) for\nanyone to to start programming, without a formal computer science education. In\nparticular, those from other engineering and science disciplines can pick up\nprogramming quickly and make a good living. But to effectively tackle\nnon-trivial tasks, you need to know the inherent capabilities and limitations of\nsoftware and recognize prior work, so you don’t waste time reinventing the\nwheel, badly. You don’t have to know everything under the sun, but you should\nhave at least a cursory familiarity with many areas and be prepared to do some\nadditional research as necessary.\n\nFor example, anyone who creates a new file format should know something about\ncompilers. I don’t mean all the code-generation optimizations like loop\nunrolling, but the basic issues and various phases of compilation and most of\nall the importance of specifying the tokenization and grammar. Nowadays, most\npeople by default will use XML, and that’s a good thing, but before then it was\ntypical to cobble up some text format, point to some generated sample files as\ndocumentation, and then everyone else who wrote another parser would cobble\nsomething up that would read in some files but not all. In the problematic cases\nthen you could point fingers either way - either the reader is bad or the writer\nis bad. Whichever product is more popular wins.\n\n> One of my pet peeves with the 3D graphics industry is the plethora of\nill-defined file formats. When I implemented an OBJ file parser for a 3D content\ncreation product, each exporting product that I tested against generated\nmarkedly different files, using different whitespace and newline conventions,\nfor example. In refreshing contrast, a coworker of mine fresh out of school\ndesigned a new game interchange format using a grammar and lexer specification.\n(These days, it’s not much of an issue anymore - most new graphics file formats\nseem to be based on XML.)\nAnd if anything differentiates programmers who can just put together simple\nscripts and user interfaces and those who can tackle real problems, it’s an\nunderstanding of computational complexity, i.e. how algorithms scale with the\nsize of the problem. Every programmer should know basic complexity terminology\nand have a general knowledge of the complexity of common problems.\n\nMy first job was in computer-aided semiconductor design, which has a lot\nscalability issues, including some NP-complete (essentially intractable)\nproblems. But some of the engineers would run around excitedly saying \"it’s the\ntraveling salesman problem!\" every time they saw a problem that couldn’t be\nsolved in linear time, and in other cases we boasted of \"linear-time\" algorithms\nwhich probably meant linear-time most-of-the-time. Or some of the time.\n\nFree Beer, Free Speech, Free Software\nOK, there’s no free beer, but this is a good time to be a programmer (well,\nrecession and outsourcing controversy notwithstanding) - just about everything\nyou need is on the Internet tutorials, discussion lists, and free software. All\nyou need is the hardware and a broadband connection.\n\nR-E-S-P-E-C-T\nOne requirement for being an effective software engineer is to be taken\nseriously. You need to have the respect of your peers and managers, at least for\nyour technical capabilities, to have control over your own work and influence\nover others.\n\nThere is Such a Thing as a Stupid Question\nReally, there are lots of stupid questions. Asking intelligent questions that\nenhance others' respect for you is a professional skill. A good question that\nexposes unresolved issues tells people that you know your stuff and you’re sharp\nenough to catch all the implications. Asking for clarification about a\nspecification shows you know how to find and read the spec and your ability to\ndetect ambiguities.\n\nIf you don’t get any answers to your question, chances are there’s something\nwrong with the question, so don’t just repeat it. Ask the question differently,\nwith more specifics, or more background. If you’ve been on the other end of a\ntechnical support line or even just spent time on discussion lists answering\nnewbie questions, you’ll appreciate the consideration.\n\n> I pride myself on cultivating good relations with developer support staff by\nsubmitting elaborate bug reports and precise questions. But I do remember one\nlapse where I tossed out something along the lines of \"What’s the deal with that\nissue that came up several weeks ago?\" You can imagine the prickly response -\n\"What do you mean by what’s the deal, and what issue are you talking about?\"\nIt doesn’t pay to be rude, especially if you’re essentially asking for free\ntutoring or consulting on a discussion list. Even if you’re asking under the\nauspices of a support contract, irritating your support contact isn’t going to\nhelp you in the long term.\n\n> I used to take pains to explain to belligerent newbies why their questions\ndidn’t make sense or what they were fundamentally doing wrong. Now, the bozo\nfilter kicks in quickly - one \"All I want to know is…​.\", and they’re ignored.\nLet everyone know that you read the documentation and googled the subject.\nBesides avoiding the inevitable \"RTFM\" and \"Google is your friend\" responses,\nthis shows you’ve done your homework and those who want to be of assistance\ndon’t have to search through the same resources. If you do expect them to search\nthrough those resources for you, then you’re saying your time is more important\nthan theirs, and you are just one more perpetrator of the \"tragedy of the\ncommons\".\n\nThere is Such a Thing as a Stupid Answer\nIf you’re going to act like you know what you’re talking about, you really\nbetter know what you’re talking about. Engineers sometimes communicate more to\nshow off their own knowledge rather than to inform (although, if you can do\nboth, kudos to you). This is often inflicted in employment interviews, under the\nguise of \"finding out how you think\" the candidate is asked inane puzzle\nquestions. This can backfire, though, if the candidate has any self respect.\n\n> One CTO interviewed me over the phone by asking me to sketch out the resulting\nstack frame from a C++ compilation and then report the result back to him\nverbally. We went through it step by step and every time I gave him a correct\nanswer he asked me to give a wrong answer instead so we could go over why that\nchoice wouldn’t work. I couldn’t tell if we were trying to demonstrate how smart\nI was or how smart he was.\nThere’s also the blame game. As an engineer, you can’t rely on your money and\nlooks - all you’ve got is your credibility. So if you make a mistake - 'fess up.\n\n> I had the privilege of working with a senior engineer who was never wrong. When\nhis Java code was crashing on multiprocessor systems, it was Sun’s bug.

As an example, one\nentrepreneur, after meeting me for coffee and asking me to sign an NDA,\npresented an app idea that involved using the built-in movie player in a manner\nthat the documentation says won’t work. Worst case, you end up paying someone to\nread the documentation that you could have.\n\nThere are some good books on app design, for example William Hecke’s Learning\niOS Design\n[http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/9780321887498/samplepages/0321887492.pdf]\n, but app design is fairly faddish, so you should look at a lot of apps,\nespecially those similar to the one you have in mind, and see how they look, the\ncolor schemes, the layouts and screen arrangements, the user interface elements\nused…try to analyze why they are the way they are, and if you have something\ndifferent in mind, whey they’re not doing it that way.\n\nAnd if you’re on Medium, you should notice one of the popular topics is app\ndesign, so there’s no shortage of material on the latest trends (and debates\nabout the trends). But the web articles I find most useful are those describing\ncompleted app projects. If you’re making a game, the postmortem articles on \ngamasutra [http://gamasutra.com/] are invaluable — they present data on the\nbudgets, team size and duration of real projects. If you expect your project to\nbe better, cheaper, faster than every other, well, that’s a nice fantasy world\nyou’re living in, send me a postcard.\n\nAt this point, you might realize you should scale back your ambitions (or maybe\nat the point the developer gives you an estimate). Especially if this is your\nfirst, app, start simple, as simple as you can. In particular, don’t start with\nan app that requires a server. If you don’t know what that means, you really\nshouldn’t have an app that requires a server, but here’s a tip — if there’s any\nkind of user login, there’s a server.\n\nRemember, you can always update the app, so you can schedule additional features\nthat way. In fact, the trend these days is frequent updates — Facebook updates\nevery two weeks, Pinterest updates every three weeks…(they even say so in the\nupdate notes), and users have come to expect regular updates. Any app that\nhasn’t been updated in a few months appears abandoned.\n\nWhich means you should think beyond the initial release of the app and plan for\nthe lifetime of the app and how it will be maintained. If you’re not planning\nany upgrades, new versions of iOS and new devices appear nearly yearly, so the\napp may require at the last some touchup to look good or even function at all.\nMake sure if your developer will not be available in the future that you will be\nable to hand off to another developer. This means having a copy of the source\ncode that can be reliably compiled. You’ll need this if you want to sell your IP\nto another publisher.\n\nOK, I’ve just listed the high-level steps on getting an app done and on the App\nStore. I haven’t gone into the various devices, screen sizes, graphics that\nsomeone will need to provide…but that’s in the reading listed above. And I\nhaven’t gone into marketing or the non-app aspects of apps. For example, a guy\nin a coffee shop recently told me he wanted to make an Uber-of-X app for $10k.\nDon’t get me started….Anyway, that’s my free consulting.

I got\nto hear that tortured dialogue when we actually recorded it in house with\nmembers of the gamedev team providing the voices (aspiring writer, meet aspiring\nvoice actors!). It didn’t sound half bad, but I did learn a few lessons:\n\nLetting the staff provide voiceovers, even temporary ones, is a great\nteam-building activity and a nice break from an otherwise unfun crunch. There’s\nsomething to be said for leaving room for actor interpretation, but sometimes it\npays to be explicit. One exclamation I put in the dialogue was uttered as a\nbored monotone, like a recorded subway message. Extroverts make the best\nscreamers (I don’t even remember writing a screaming scene). It’s hard to avoid\nmaking exertion noises sound sexual (I’m reminded of a behind-the-scenes clip on\na Buffy DVD where Joss Whedon yells at Darla the vampire, “Less orgasmic!”).\nSomeone’s always going to interpret something as homoerotic. My response is that\ngreat writing is open to interperation and he who smelt it, dealt it. Expect\nsignificant rewrites to accomodate game design changes, even small ones. A minor\nrearrangement in one level resulted in reordering some dialogue in a way that\nmade no sense.\n\nAlas, the game was cancelled (not due to the writing, I hope), although possibly\nrepurposed and cancelled later, or perhaps even published in some mutated form a\nlawsuit or two later. In any case, I assume my writing didn’t survive, but if\nyou’ve got a game to ship in a few hours and you need some writing done, drop me\na line.","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/04/f68fefb311f9bc8f045445280b1a6ba1.png","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2021-02-21T18:46:12.000Z","updated_at":"2021-04-11T14:36:39.000Z","published_at":"2021-02-21T18:48:06.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null},{"id":"6032b6bd95a4b90039109ede","uuid":"6748d592-6c9b-4669-a8ae-8ba0450e5491","title":"The History of Programming","slug":"the-history-of-programming","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_History_of_Western_Philosophy\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Story_of_Civilization\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Vincent_Atanasoff\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Byron\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Bletchley_Park\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adele_Goldberg_%28computer_scientist%29\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Liskov\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language)\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Difference_Engine\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"On my list of things-I-want-to-do-but-I’m-not-serious-just-talking is a history of computers, or at least a history of computer programming, something like Bertrand Russell’s \"],[0,[0],1,\"History of Western Philosophy\"],[0,[],0,\" or Will and Ariel Durant’s \"],[0,[1],1,\"Story of Civilization\"],[0,[],0,\".\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"I got this interest during my one and only stint in academic teaching as an assistant to Computer Literacy 101 at Johns Hopkins University.

I've been working on it for six years, now - I wouldn't go so far as to say it's a labor of love, but at least a work of mild fondness. So here's what happened.</p><p><strong>What Went Right</strong></p><p><strong>Keeping Bridges Unburnt</strong></p><p>This version of HyperBowl came about because I worked on the original HyperBowl, developed by Hyper Entertainment and first deployed as an attraction game at the Sony Metreon in San Francisco.

I’ve been holding off on a postmortem for my Unity version\nof HyperBowl [http://hyperbowl3d.com/], a 3D bowling game in which you bowl\nthrough various fantasy worlds (ancient Rome, the deck of a rocking ship, the\nstreets of San Francisco…), until I achieved Flappy Bird success, but maybe I\nshouldn’t hold my breath. I've been working on it for six years, now - I\nwouldn't go so far as to say it's a labor of love, but at least a work of mild\nfondness. So here's what happened.\n\nWhat Went Right\n\nKeeping Bridges Unburnt\n\nThis version of HyperBowl came about because I worked on the original HyperBowl,\ndeveloped by Hyper Entertainment and first deployed as an attraction game at the\nSony Metreon in San Francisco. I only worked at Hyper Entertainment for the\nfirst few months of 2001 but kept in touch with the Director of Development\nthere, Aaron Pulkka (now running his own show at Rabbx [http://rabbx.com/]).\n\nAround the time Unity announced their upcoming iPhone support, I mentioned to\nAaron  that I thought that would be a good way to get HyperBowl running on the\niPhone. He agreed and suggested I just ask the owners of Hyper, and whaddya\nknow, they said sure, they’re not actively developing it anymore, so why not.\nAnd thus they granted me a license to develop it for the web, Mac/PC, mobile and\nthe Wii (basically everything that Unity supported at the time).\n\nUsing Unity\n\nUnity was the right choice for the game engine. In a way, Unity chose HyperBowl,\nas I started using Unity in 2007 because it ran on a Mac and had a webplayer and\nI happened to meet Joachim Ante at WWDC.  I only thought of porting HyperBowl to\nthe iPhone a couple of years later when I heard the plans for Unity iPhone\nsupport and immediately thought how the screen aspect ratio of the iPhone was a\ngood match for the tall projection screen of the original attraction game\n(nowadays, you can still find some of the attraction HyperBowls still running in\nvenues like Dave and Busters with upended flat screen TVs replacing the original\nscreens).\n\nSo using Unity was the expedient choice and default choice, but it turned out to\nbe a good choice. I didn’t realize at the time it would be as popular as it is\ntoday (I believe this was before they made the Indie version free) and this was\nbefore Unity Android. The multi-platform support is a huge advantage. Even\nthough my focus is mobile, I’ve also made Mac, Windows, webplayer, Flash, and\nMac widget versions of HyperBowl, and the only major code difference is the\nbetween the touchscreen and mouse-driven control code.\n\nI could have eschewed middleware altogether, but I had enough trouble just\nresuscitating the code enough for the asset conversion, much less port it to\nmultiple new platforms. And I would have had to implement or do without a lot of\ngoodies that we take for granted in modern game engines, like bump map shaders\nand dynamic shadows.\n\nGetting the Source Code\n\nIn addition to the license, Hyper Entertainment provided the original source\nassets, including the audio, textures, models and also the source code for both\nthe arcade and Windows versions of the game. And not just the files, but the\noriginal development PCs, one with the arcade version and one with the Windows\nversion, so I was able to compare them and choose one as a starting point.\n\nThe first thing I did after booting up the PCs, even before connecting to the\nInternet, was copy everything I could find onto DVDs and my own computers, then\ncommitting everything to version control. This was fortuitous, as I next made\nthe mistake of connecting one PC to the Internet, and instead of something\nmomentous like the Forbin Project, it bogged down downloading a gazillion\nWindows Updates and ultimately suffered a hard disk crash. The other PC\neventually just crashed on its own.\n\nExporting to FBX\n\nAfter a few unsuccessful attempts at running the original assets to Unity’s\naccepted file formats through various converters (and enduring one vendor’s “I\nam the super guru of 3D conversion software”), I decided I might as well export\nthe data directly from the game and that Unity’s preferred model format really\nwas FBX. When I tried converting the game assets to OBJ format, for example,\nthose files wouldn’t import successfully into Unity, and then when I tried the\nOBJ converter included in the FBX SDK and got the same result, I figured Unity\nis just using those same converters to FBX under the hood, so might as well just\nskip the middleman.\n\nSo I got the old code to build just well enough, with a few generations newer\nVisual Studio and stubbed out calls to old middleware, to the point where I\ncould launch the game and load the lanes (equivalent to levels). That’s was good\nenough to integrate the FBX SDK and and have the game immediately write FBX\nfiles for each lane (level) on startup (and startup was about the only thing it\ncould do).\n\nIn retrospect, this was by far the better approach, and not just because the\nother approach wasn’t working. If I had been able to convert all the original\nmodel files, I would have had to manually import them into Unity and then\nmanually reconstruct the scene hierarchy for each lane, or write some Unity\nEditor scripts to perform the reconstruction. With each lane as a single FBX\nfile exported from the game, I just had a handful of FBX files to import and no\npiecing together with Unity was necessary.\n\nPrototyping an App\n\nWhile I was trying to figure out how to convert the original HyperBowl assets,\nin order to test my idea for the bowling controls, I created a no frills bowling\napp, called Fugu Bowl (in the mode of Ford cars, I preface my other app names\nwith Fugu, under the Fugu Games label. It’s a long story that involves watching\nthe Food Network late at night).\n\nThe control I had in mind, swiping the screen to roll the ball (although with\nUnity’s game engine, PhysX, it works better to push the ball rather than apply a\ntorque), is intended to emulate the trackball-like operation of the original\nbowling ball controller. In fact, the arcade version essentially had a\ntrackball, whereas the original attraction game featured a real bowling ball\nthat required you to put some weight into it.\n\nI thought the result worked pretty well, and the app was surprisingly popular,\ndespite consisting only of a monochromatic ball, capsules for pins, a plane for\nthe bowling lane, and no bowling game rules beyond playing kids boos and cheers\nfor gutters, spares and strikes. This was probably largely due to introducing\nthe app in the early days of the App Store. It was my first app (another reason\nto release a simple app, first – figure out all those App Store submission\nintricacies), but it does pain me a little bit that my first app is still my\nmost downloaded app.\n\nFans on Facebook\n\nOf course I did the social media thing: twitter, google+, youtube…but the most\nsuccessful platform has been the HyperBowl Facebook group. Currently it has a\nbit over 800 “fans”, but more important than the quantity, some of them are\nloyal, supportive, enthusiastic fans who provide suggestions, requests, bug\nreports, and even localization (got some help on Chinese and French). Showing\nthe benefit of a licensed title, many of the Facebook fans enjoyed the original\nattraction or Windows version of the game.\n\nQuick tip: you can set up your Facebook page to automatically share posts to a\ntwitter feed. This hopefully will new users to both your game and the Facebook\npage and saves you the trouble of manually posting the same news on two\ndifferent social platforms.\n\nIndie Is In\n\nThe first reviews, among all my apps, included a lot of negative reviews. And by\nnegative, I mean snarky, condescending and amazingly prone to affront by a cheap\nor free app. That’s pretty rare, now, and I don’t think it’s because my apps\nimproved. The biggest difference, I believe, is that indie is in. People\nsympathize with the single developer or small studio and recognize there are\nlimited resources, and even if they don’t like the product, they appreciate the\neffort. Even now, a harsh criticism can turn into a supportive message if I\nrespond, hey, I’m the only one working on this.\n\nThat’s from the peanut gallery. The other source of snobbery is from the\nI’m-a-gamedev-pro-and-this-isn’t-AAA crowd. I’ve seen comments like this in\ngamedev forums, too, but when that game designer who’s used to working in a\nstudio has to come crawling back for simple help in scripting, the attitude\nchanges. By now, enough game developers have gone from salaried work to budding\niPhone game developers (and then often back to salaried work – there really\nshould be a rotational system where we can swap places), AAA elitism seems to\nhave dissipated.\n\nWhat Went Wrong\n\nExporting to FBX\n\nConverting the original game assets to FBX was definitely the way to go, but it\nwasn’t fun. When people say they dream of becoming game programmers (people do\nsay that, right?) I’m sure they’re not talking about becoming toolchain\nprogrammers.\n\nAmazingly, I could not recognize a single line of HyperBowl code I wrote that\nlong ago, even though there are portions I’m sure I must have written (I was not\none of the original HyperBowl programmers, but I put in some optimizations and\nupdates to work with newer graphics hardware). But whoever wrote it, that code\nwas generally clean – it’s not hard to traverse the scene and gather all the\nmodel and texture info.\n\nThe part I didn’t like was working with the FBX SDK. Contrary to popular belief,\nFBX is not a file format. Sure, it has a file format, but it’s deliberately\nundocumented – they tell you not to mess with trying to read/write the file\nyourself, but instead do everything through the SDK, which changes whenever\n(when FBX is called an “industry standard”, that just means Autodesk, kind of\nlike the Borg was industry standard). So I had to make sure I was writing a\nversion of the FBX mystery meat that Unity could read, since it was running on\nthe previous version of the SDK, and that involved some weird string matching in\nthe writer initialization (as I recall, there’s no way to say “I just want that\none”).\n\nThe irony is that the game files I was converting to FBX were actually in a\nproprietary, but obsolete, format that had the same model as FBX – undocumented\nformat, always use the SDK. Because the vendor will always be around, right?\n\nLosing the Source Code\n\nNot to fear, I didn’t lose the source code! At least, not the original source\ncode. And I’ve got all the Unity projects also hosted offset in version control.\nNo, the stuff I lost was the jury-rigged FBX export I wedged into the original\ngame. I probably wasn’t careful about saving it because I figured I’d never need\nto run it again. In fact, I was so sick of repeatedly exporting to FBX,\nimporting into Unity, realizing something was off then tweaking and repeating\nthe export, that I left some details up to manual fixes inside Unity.\n\nFor example, the texture coordinates were coming out flipped from the way Unity\nwas interpreting them so all the textures were displayed upside down. That’s\nsomething I should have fixed in the exporter, but I had reached the point where\nI couldn’t stand it anymore and just manually adjusted them within the Unity\nEditor. But that means I’d have to do it every time I reexported. However, one\nPC crash and a few years later, when I thought about adding some optimizations\nto the export (e.g. the camera is always facing one direction as you bowl, so\nevery static backfacing poly in the scene could be removed) I was faced with the\nprospect of reimplementing the whole thing. So that’s it, as long as Unity can\nread FBX files from 2007, the pipeline is closed.\n\nToo Little Marketing\n\nI think the HyperBowl Facebook page looks good and has a decent number of\nfollowers, and I’m doing OK in general on twitter (though that’s not\nHyperBowl-specific). But my other attempts at marketing have been at best\nsporadic. Theoretically, I’m willing to put spend on marketing when I have the\ntime and income, but that’s like saying I’ll do it when I’m unemployed yet\nmaking money.\n\nWhen I’m between paying gigs, I do at least put more effort into marketing, and\nI think it does make a difference in sales. Putting out promo codes, frequent\nupdates (which is a way of getting more promo codes), Facebook posts,\nlocalization (China sales are up), contacting reviewers and bloggers, that all\nseems to help, although with the market getting more and more crowded,\neverything makes less and less of a difference. To be honest, my all-time\nrevenue graph  is more or less bell shaped, with the peak occurring a couple of\nChristmases ago.\n\nA note about piracy. For a while, someone was cracking my iOS app within hours\nof every update. I find that obnoxious, and contrary to what some piracy\ndefenders say, it didn’t seem to help sales. But it didn’t seem to hurt sales,\neither. On the other hand, in the past few months the number of cracked Android\nAPKs have proliferated (not just download sites but also activations, dutifully\ntracked by Unity Analytics), and during the same period my Google Play sales\nhave dropped dramatically. Probably unrelated, but hmm…\n\nToo Little Monetization\n\nWhen I started making apps, I didn’t really consider incorporating ads, partly\nbecause there wasn’t a convenient way to try out an ad service without writing\nyour own Unity plugin, and partly because I don’t like seeing ads, myself. So\nfor every app, I charged or left it free. But one day I saw that prime31 had\nintroduced an iAd plugin, so I tried it out on my trustworthy testbed app, Fugu\nBowl, just so I would know how to set up iAds. Several months later, I checked\nmy ad revenue and realized I was making some money. “Ads for everyone!” I\nproclaimed.\n\nUnity now includes API access to iAds, so the prime31 plugin is not necessary (I\nkeep it around as a fallback just in case – for a while, the early Unity iAd\nimplementation was not as polished as the prime31 plugin). The generalized Unity\nad API doesn’t include AdMob or anything else on Android, so there I’m still\nusing a prime31 plugin. I might try Unity Ads at some point, or Chartboost (I’ve\nreceived some developer recommendations), or maybe I’ll drag myself onto the\nfreemium bandwagon and implement in-app purchases. (“IAP for everyone” I will\nproclaim)\n\nToo Much Monetization\n\nBy too much monetization, I don’t mean too much money. I wish. Rather, one of my\nfew real regrets is wasting time trying out various mobile ad networks just\nbecause someone emailed me. First of all, it’s just annoying that the account\nrep always want you to set up a skype chat instead of just providing a\ndocumented SDK. And then it’s laborious explaining to the rep later, slowly,\nthat the reason you’re no longer using it is that it earns a pittance or it\ndoesn’t work the way you want (or at all).\n\nI realize I may not be getting the best revenue from my current ad networks (iAd\nand AdMob) but my current setup is convenient and reliable, and the time spent\nswitching back and forth between other ad networks and plugins is better spent\ntrying to attain Flappy Bird numbers.\n\nToo Little\n\nThis may seem like just a technical detail, but after importing all the lanes, I\ndiscovered all of the geometry was smaller than expected by a factor of 100,\nassuming one distance unit in Unity should represent one meter (and it does, if\nyou go by the default physics settings, lighting distances, camera scripts and\nso on).

Still, I miss Lisp.</em></p><p>My favorite language is Lisp. What happened?</p><h2 id=\"what-i-miss-about-lisp\">What I Miss About Lisp</h2><h3 id=\"simplicity\">Simplicity</h3><p>A common complaint against Lisp is the parentheses. Lots of Interspersed Spurious Parentheses. That’s pretty funny, but it’s wrong. The parentheses are not spurious — each one serves a purpose, and if your program compiles, you have exactly the number you need. And there is no question about operator precedence or scope. I’ve never heard Lisp haters say they’re confused by parentheses — they just find them annoying.</p><p>But a combination of curly braces, parentheses, brackets, periods and commas is simpler and more succinct? No one has ever had to pop open a Lisp book to remember its syntax (although I did wear out my CLtL2 referencing all the built-in functions). Think how many hours have been lost to Java and C/C++ operator precedence bugs, forgetting to add brackets when expanding a single-line if clause (and Eclipse will nag me about unnecessary brackets if I try to play it safe) and the endless debates among programmers about their favorite bracket usage and placement conventions.</p><h3 id=\"elegance\">Elegance</h3><p>A related complaint is that Lisp is too strange and hard to understand. There is a misguided notion that programming languages should resemble English. Which has given us COBOL, BASIC and AppleScript. (I have fond memories of BASIC, and Microsoft had a pretty good run with it, but no one’s going to write AI programs or even web server applications with it). English expression of computer programs is as efficient and clear as writing mathematical formulas in English.</p><p>Simplicity lends itself to elegance. You know you’re using an elegant language if you’re not distracted by discussions of proper style. I don’t recall wasting time on coding style debates when working in Lisp. But after moving to Java and C++, nearly every organization I joined made a big deal about adherence to a coding standard, which usually involved some variation of the the abomination known as Hungarian notation. (Although Sun has defined a perfectly readable and simple style exemplified in the Java standard class libraries, and Hungarian notation is a monster when applied to object-oriented languages). A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, the saying goes. So is a mandated coding style. When you’re programming, you should be thinking more about the problem than the language.</p><h3 id=\"flexibility\">Flexibility</h3><p>The syntax makes possible a unique feature of Lisp, one that every satisfied Common Lisp user seems to appreciate — macros. “Macros” seems like such a mundane name — C macros or Excel macros are hardly in the same league. What other language allows you to implement new constructs that can even define new control flow, in a way that blends in with the built-in syntax? It’s a small price to pay for parentheses.</p><p>After using Flavors, Object Lisp, C++ and Java, I still have to say the Common Lisp Object System is the best. Generic functions, eql parameters, multiple inheritance (yes, it’s a good thing), a metaobject protocol that lets you customize the object system — nothing else matches it.</p><h3 id=\"optimization\">Optimization</h3><p>A fallacy about Lisp is that it’s slow. Of course, it’s easy to write slow code in any language, and even easier in Lisp because 1) it’s big, and tends to be slow just to start up, 2) automatic memory management and a run-time type system has an overhead and 3) Lisp is easy to learn — any idiot can learn it well enough to produce a complicated, messy prototype of something that looks sophisticated (although it takes an idiot with taste to appreciate it).</p><p>But it’s really the best of both worlds. You can prototype an application quickly and clearly, and then optimize — at the algorithmic and data structure level as with any language, but also at the language level, e.g. by adding declarations that turn off run-time type checking. This avoids a scenario like the application I worked on that was prototyped in Tcl — and stayed in Tcl for two years while the development tried to figure out how to migrate it to another language.</p><p>It’s painful to watch Java follow in Lisp’s footsteps and yet apparently not learn all its lessons. I worked on a high-performance 3D content creation tool in Lisp — I still cannot imagine that a 3D Java application can perform as well.</p><h3 id=\"culture\">Culture</h3><p>Lisp had a cool culture. Much like AI labs, it attracted groupies of dubious ability but also some of the most brilliant programmers around. And I mean brilliant in a worldly, literate, sense. Lisp programmers don’t make lists of design patterns, although Richard Gabriel did a lot of writing on how design patterns were originally applied to architecture.

It’s not quite so popular for that, now (another essay — Why Didn’t Java Become Flash?) but it was a great introduction that made Java an everday word. Java hasn’t exactly dominated the desktop and has been hit and miss in various areas, but has been targeted successfully in the web server and mobile phone arenas. Common Lisp never had such a hook.

And they shared an office. Every Friday at 9am, the manager would turn\naround in his swivel chair and say to his officemate, “Ready for our meeting?”\n\nSometimes meetings are held just to remind everyone who’s the boss. If that’s\nwhat it takes, you’ve got other problems.\n\nThe Standup\nI’m not a fan of scrum. And I don’t mean rugby. The thing I hate about the\nvariant of Agile Development called Scrum is its defining characteristic, the\ndaily standup meeting.\n\nThe daily standup is a reaction to the traditional weekly meeting, but it’s no\nbetter. Rather than waste an hour of everyone’s time once a week, it takes ten\nminutes of everyone’s time every day. Factor in the context-switch time of\nbreaking off work and then returning to work, it’s not a real time-saver.\n\nThe daily meetings are also a ritualization of the what-are-you-doing-right-now\nschool of management, which is not exactly goal-oriented. It’s irritating enough\nto have a manager go around a table once a week and ask “what are you working\non?” but to go through that every day is like being in kindergarten. And when I\ndid sit (stand) through such daily meetings, I still had middle management come\nby later in the day to ask “what are you working on?” (I always wanted to ask\nthem the same question)\n\nThe Pep Rally\nI am forever grateful to the high school math teacher who let us spirit-impaired\nnerds hide out in the computer lab during pep rallies. They were a welcome break\nfrom class, but the fact that hip-waggling cheerleaders stirring up support for\nour football team (despite its two consecutive years of losses) warranted time\ntaken out of our studies gives some indication why this country isn’t preeminent\nin primary education.\n\nRah-rah corporate meetings also provide a break from work, minus the\ncheerleaders. They’re really an opportunity for the CEO to flex his CEO muscles\n— an exercise in power management. Sometimes the hypnosis works and employees\nfall under the sway of the exalted leader, and sometimes they just find the guy\nannoying, but I’ve never seen employees come away actually more encouraged and\ndetermined to work harder.\n\nThe Come to Jesus Meeting\nI’ve heard these referred to as “come to Jesus” meetings, but I think of them as\npanic meetings, where management realizes, belatedly, that things are not as\nthey should be, and calls an all-hands meeting to tell everyone to shape up.\nI’ve never seen anyone come out of these meetings energized to work. Usually,\nthey go off to polish their resumes.\n\nThe Group Hug\nAt one point during my first job (the worst jobs have the best stories), a\nself-appointed morale coordinator who apparently had nothing better to do first\nissued Briggs-Meyer tests (we just handed the forms to our friends so we all got\nthe presonality profiles we wanted), and then when team unity failed to result,\nset up an off-site two-day team-building session, down the street from our\noffice. We held hands, took turns “confessing” how we could have done a better\njob (mostly phrased as “I could have done a better job in helping that guy do\nhis job”, except for the fundamentalist Baptist who refused to confess because\nhe wasn’t Catholic).\n\nHere’s an idea for a team-building exercise: finish the project.\n\nA Few Good Meetings\nDespite my allergic reaction to meetings, I do believe a few can be useful, and\nthey may be appreciated more for their rarity.\n\nThe Kickoff\nThe first useful team meeting is the project kickoff meeting. It’s important to\nmake sure everyone is on the same page from the very beginning.\n\nOn my first project where I was a lead, I thought the project goals were pretty\nclear. But after a few months, the team members actually requested a meeting.\nAfter that, no one asked for another meeting, so either it was satisfactory or\ntotally useless, but I do wish I held that meeting at the beginning.\n\nThe Countdown\nThere is one part of a project where I do think it’s important to for everyone\nto get together and know exactly what’s going on — that’s the final days before\na project release. The code should be frozen and undergoing extensive testing at\nthis point — every day there should be a meeting to go over the latest test\nresults and decide what to do about them.\n\nThe Postmortem\nMemories fade quickly, so start off the new project cycle with a meeting to\ndiscuss lessons learned. And anyone who feels abused by the past project is\nlikely to be annoyed enough to honestly air their views.\n\nHowever, even meeting-happy managers I’ve worked for have been reluctant to hold\npostmortem meetings, ostensibly to avoid finger-pointing (probably at\nthemselves), but I suspect also because the point of a postmortem meeting is to\ntake a hard, realistic look at the process and make any necessary changes. And\nno one wants to do that.\n\nI did participate on one video game project that held a few postmortem meetings\nafter milestone deliveries, and the sessions were useful in refining our\nprocess. Too bad all that got thrown out the window at crunch time.\n\nUse Technology\nTechnology has changed how we do nearly everything — entertainment, travel,\nshopping, managing our finances. So why should we hold meetings the same old way\nlike cavemen grouped around a fire? Some technologies, like videoconferencing,\njust make it easier to have more meetings, much as some technologies create more\npaper instead of advancing us toward the paperless office. But technologies that\nwe use to streamline the rest of our lives, standard stuff like email and web\nbrowsing, can minimize the number and duration of meetings.\n\nStatus Reports\nThe most important email everyone can issue is the the weekly email report.\nRather than wait for a meeting to go around and ask everyone for a status report\n(the most painfully boring type of meeting), the reports instead can be composed\nand emailed by each member of the team before the meeting — ideally, the day\nbefore the meeting. Then everyone can put some time and thought into the report,\ninstead of dredging it up on the fly in the meeting, and everyone can spend some\ntime digesting the reports before the meeting and consider issues to bring up at\nthe meeting.\n\nIn all cases where I’ve seen the weekly email report initiated, the time spent\nin the weekly meeting easily halved, and the content of the meeting was more\nfocused. Moreover, email reports serve as written records that can be easily\nreferenced, instead of “I’m sure I mentioned this at the meeting two weeks\nago….”\n\nWhether or not the weekly report happens before the meeting or during, the\ncontent should not be “what I did this week”. (I had one coworker recount his\ntrip to the dentist, and that was one of his more productive weeks) It’s a\n“status” report, not a “what have you been doing” report. If you’re more\nconcerned about how people are spending every minute than what actually gets\ndone, then you’re better off installing monitoring software at every\nworkstation. Asking people what they’ve been doing sends a message that you care\nmore about looking busy than what’s actually getting done.\n\nThe report should contain information that is actually useful and gives everyone\nelse on the team a feeling that they know what’s going on. And, to put it\ncrassly, it’s also a CYA device for developers who feel their contributions and\nconcerns may be glossed over by their managers. (To put it less crassly, think\nof it as an implementation of the open-door policy that companies like to brag\nabout) The reports should include:\n\nChanges made to the system that everyone else should see. (For source code,\nthese are changes committed to the source code repository and can be verified by\nothers, not in-progress code that is on the developer’s machine).\n\nDependencies that the developer is waiting on — hardware, test cases from QA,\ncode from other developers, decisions from management.\n\nProblems that require attention — current approach is not working out, the\ndeveloper is overloaded, progress is slow and target date will not be reached\nwithout more resources or trimmed features.\n\nEveryone should issue a weekly report, not just the programmers. There are a lot\nof tools for monitoring software development — keeping track of marketing, sales\nand management activity is another matter. If every department is made more\n“transparent”, that can counter the typical perception from engineers that\neveryone else is on a coffee break while they’re under the gun. And if it turns\nout some people don’t have anything to report (or are reporting the same thing\nfor weeks on end) then now you know you’ve got a situation.\n\nThe Intranet\nAll project information should be accessible on a local intranet server. These\ndays, it’s not uncommon to find a wiki set up on the intranet — this makes it\neasy for project members to add and correct project information. And then\nthere’s no excuse for anyone to not understand what’s going on in the project.\n\nBad Technology\nOn the other hand, say no to instant messaging and any other form of\ncommunication that facilitates interruption. Whereas use of email promotes\nthought and clarity in expression and response, instant messaging caters to the\nshort attention span. I had one manager who couldn’t stop reading and writing\nher IM even while I was standing next to her giving a status report. Great\nexample for the staff!\n\nSome managers don’t like their employees wasting time instant messaging with the\noutside world, but internal IM is even more damaging — coworkers and managers\nwill get in the bad habit of expecting instant responses to off-the-cuff\nquestions, instead of well thought out answers to valid questions.\n\nStay Focused\nHave an Agenda\nIt’s easier to get decisions made in a meeting if you plan the meeting that way.\nThere are few events more uninteresting than going around the room asking for\neach individual to give a report. Once you get rid of the round-the-table\nwhat-have-you-done routine, then it becomes clearer that you should have an\nagenda (and if you can’t think of one, then there’s no point in having the\nmeeting).\n\nCertainly, a standard part of the weekly meeting agenda should be to address any\nconcerns that have been raised in the weekly reports.\n\nRelease the Hostages\nNow that you have an agenda for your meeting, stick to it. This doesn’t mean\nslavish devotion to a list or formula — just remember why you’re there.\n\nSome people take advantage of having a captive audience in meetings. One company\npresident would regale us with a review of last weekend’s movie she saw or game\nshe played, or relate some formative event in her life. Another producer would\nspend the beginning of the meeting telling bawdy stories and insulting the\nFrench, then snap at everyone else to stay focussed. Remember, it’s not a social\ngathering. Save the fraternizing for happy hour.\n\nStart on Time\nThe first aspect of a meeting is, obviously, starting the meeting. Adhering to a\nstrict start time sets the right tone — get going, get to the high points, and\nget this meeting over with so we can get back to work. On the other hand,\ninconsistent start times not only waste time as people sit around waiting for\nthe meeting to start, it sends a subtle message that time is not valuable, or\nthat some people’s time is not as valuable as others.\n\nI had one manager who would repeatedly postpone a meeting to attend to various\nthings, and then she would complain about how she had to round up everyone for\nthe meeting when it actually took place. Not only was this was just annoying,\nbut it meant no one could effectively plan their work around the meeting — you\nwould either get interrupted right in the middle of trying to figure something\nout or you’d be twiddling your thumbs waiting for the damned thing to happen.\nNot a good way to promote time management discipline in a project that was\nalready challenged with a tough schedule.\n\nEnd on Time\nThe reasons for starting meetings on time also apply to ending them on time.\n\nThe best regular meetings I ever attended were held by an MIT professor for his\nresearch group who always ended his weekly meetings on time. Even if there were\nmore items that could have been discussed, the professor still adjourned the\nmeeting and we tabled the discussion for next time. I left that meeting never\nfeeling that it dragged on, and on at least a few occasions I felt it was\nproductive and worth the time!\n\nEnding early is OK, but letting a meeting go over the prearranged time is the\nsame as allowing a schedule overrun. If you can’t keep a meeting on schedule,\nwhat hope is there for keeping the project on schedule?\n\nWrite it Down\nHave you been to meetings that seemed like the movie Groundhog Day? Same day of\nthe week, same time, same topics, only it feels like you’re the only one who\nremembers going through all of this before. (“Vampire topics” that repeatedly\ncome back to life, as one of my friends termed them) Or perhaps you’re one of\nthe blissfully bringing up the same topic again and again.\n\nI participated in a two-day annual sales meeting for a startup company where\nsupposedly we discussed our product plans and marketing strategies. You’d think\nin a startup with one product and only a handful of sales and marketing folks,\nsomeone would remember whatever was decided at that meeting, but I found myself\nrepeating peevishly for months, “We discussed this at the meeting!”.\n\nThere’s not much point to a meeting where decisions made are not remembered. So\nmake sure everything of note in the meeting is written down and distributed to\neveryone who should know what’s going on. The intranet wiki is a great place for\nthat — then you have a history of meeting results that you can refer to.\n\nThe problem isn’t always due to short-term memories (possibly salespeople only\nremember as far back as their last commissions). Sometimes memory is selective,\nespecially among management.\n\nOn a video game project where I was the sole programmer for a specific platform,\nthe president of the company asked if we could develop an interactive previewer\nfor that package. I responded that we didn’t have the manpower to do that and\nstay on schedule — if it was important, we needed a tools programmer. Yet that\ntopic kept coming up — either she kept forgetting my answer or thought I would\neventually forget.\n\nAnd if you do have someone record the meeting results, make sure the recorder\ncan do so reliably. Case in point: one of my coworkers who was regularly\naggressive in pushing his own agenda was all too eager to record our weekly\nmeeting results. Somehow, the meeting minutes always indicated his opinions had\nprevailed.\n\nHaving a fictitious record of a meeting is even worse than having no record.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2021-02-22T18:08:54.000Z","updated_at":"2021-11-10T02:30:42.000Z","published_at":"2021-02-22T18:17:32.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null},{"id":"60354c2835acd30039f5b1ea","uuid":"878ee5b4-260a-49e2-a119-cc1046eb64a8","title":"Carl Melcher Goes to Vietnam","slug":"carl-melcher-goes-to-vietnam","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[[\"em\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epinions\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://bookshop.org/books/carl-melcher-goes-to-vietnam/9781468130997\",\"rel\",\"nofollow\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[0],1,\"Written after my Epinions phase but still quite a while ago.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Last week, I checked out the local Dave and Buster’s (it’s a happening place on Friday night, like Chuck E Cheese with a bar), and I was reminded of the \"],[0,[1],1,\"Epinions\"],[0,[],0,\" meet ‘n greet they held at the Irvine Spectrum Dave and Buster’s oh so long ago, when Epinions was cool and before they were bought by shopping.com (which was later bought by eBay).\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Along with BBQ wings, some books were handed out at that shindig, including Paul Clayton’s self-published \"],[0,[2],1,\"Carl Melcher Goes to Vietnam\"],[0,[],0,\" (I heard he got a publishing deal, but I haven’t seen any other edition of the book).

This inspired the project manager to establish a day-to-day task list for each engineer during the next two weeks. When I clarified that I really meant “when do we have to have something you’re going to show”, upper management commiserated and then informed us that we had to show a demo to investors at the company launch party in a few weeks! The micromanagement list went out the window and we scrambled to implement the key features needed for demo. (We came close, but I can’t say it was a success — we got the demo running just as the party was winding down, and the funding fell through.)</p><p>A project’s life or death hinges on getting good demos in the premier trade shows, satisfying contractual deliveries to clients, and timely appearance on the market. The entire project revolves around these expectations, so the first job in scheduling is to figure out these expectations and make them and their assumptions explicit.</p><h2 id=\"it-s-a-deadline-not-a-guideline\">It’s a Deadline, Not a Guideline</h2><p>After understanding what a schedule is, the next important thing is to take it seriously. Know your schedule, and make sure everyone on your project knows it.</p><p>I was astounded on one project when casually mentioned our recent product release and a fellow engineer on the project didn’t know what I was talking about. But I couldn’t blame him for that head-in-the-sand mentality — our management would announce “stop coding, we’re making a release today” and then justify it with “well, the beta release date was last week.”</p><p>Any computer scientist should be able to tell you that constraints are a good thing when it comes to problem-solving — they narrow down what you can and can’t do. Take advantage of the fixed milestones in your schedule, like trade shows. Milestones that you can’t shuffle around in self-denial are useful, like the scale that won’t lie about your weight.</p><p>Every missed deadline means the next one will be taken that much less seriously. And every project that runs overtime means the next project will start and end that much later.</p><p>In a surreal moment, just a few weeks before a product release, timed to coincide with the premier industry trade show, and right after I’d dissuaded the company president from demanding new features by pointing at the bug list, a well-intentioned marketing manager suggested to me “why don’t we postpone the release by a month so you guys have more time to work on it?” Setting aside the trade show, which should have concerned him more than me, we had a supplementary feature release scheduled just three months after that, and then big upgrade a few months later. Delaying the release by a month would have just delayed all the other releases. And it wouldn’t have saved us any work — we would just have been behind by one release month.</p><p>Stick with the schedule. There’s always a next time, if you get this one done on time. And while delivering late is criminal, there’s no sin in delivering early.</p><p>For some reason, even when given the option to either a) release the product early or b) take the extra time to test the product, management usually elects option c) squeeze in a new feature that jeopardizes the the product and the schedule. (In fairness, engineers are often complicit — “sure, it’ll just take an afternoon”). The one time I’ve seen a product delivered early took place after the president of the company gave the development manager a fake release date. I can’t imagine that working more than once, though.</p><h2 id=\"it-s-macro-not-micro\">It’s Macro, Not Micro</h2><p>When I shop for groceries, I know it’s not going to take more than half an hour, and I’ll spend about forty dollars (sixty, if I’m hungry). I know this because I’ve bought groceries before, and that’s generally how long and how much it takes.</p><p>Now, if I plan my grocery expedition by listing all the items I think I’m going to buy, estimating the unit price of each item, and predicting how much time it will take to park the car, locate each item, stand in the checkout line, and unload each item, my schedule will be off by the time I reach the first aisle. It’s unlikely that my predicted individual prices will be on the money, so to speak, but it would be a waste of time to recalculate my schedule every time I find an item and its actual price. Even if I have a detailed grocery list written down, I’m only committed to the items I really need (can’t postpone getting that cat litter) — I may purchase additional items that happen to be on sale and omit items that turn out to be too expensive or are unavailable.</p><p>The same goes for project scheduling. Estimate project durations based on what you know of previous projects — that’s where experience comes in, and that’s a big reason why senior engineers should get paid more, if they’ve learned anything. Estimating project durations by summing up individual tasks only works if you’ve worked on exactly the same kind of project before and know every single task and possible schedule deviations that could happen in that type of project. In which case, you’d already know how long the total thing took, so why not use that, anyway?</p><p>I worked on one distributed simulation project where the manager’s office wall was completely covered with a Microsoft Project schedule. I assume this included every task going into the project (and maybe tasks not going in). But this project actually had a very simple schedule — have the simulation ready for the exercise date in six months, or the exercise would proceed without us. Major milestones, like having the software components ready for integration, the network hardware up and running comfortably ahead of the exercise date, and even my security clearance so I could start work, took months longer than they should have. Yet we had our meetings where everyone reported that everything was going fine and more paper went on that scheduling wall. The final month of that project was an exercise in panic and triage.</p><p>Schedule the major milestones first — the final release, the beta and alpha releases, and the interim milestones like first QA release and trade show demos. These are your hard targets — everything else can, and will, be more malleable, as you find certain technologies are working out better than others, you have to deal with staff turnover, sick days and vacations. I personally don’t feel it’s useful to schedule tasks to a granularity smaller than a week, but regardless, don’t let your micro-schedule drive your macro-schedule — tracking low-level tasks looks good on paper, but the feeling of control is illusory — it’s no substitute for “macro” planning.</p><h2 id=\"it-s-not-a-negotiation\">It’s Not a Negotiation</h2><p>I’ve worked with managers and clients who would ask for a time estimate on a task, and then respond to the estimate with “why should it take so long”, or “can you get it done sooner?”. There are several things wrong with this approach: If you’re taking issue with an estimate, that indicates you already had a preconception of what the estimate would be. There’s no reason to believe a revised estimate will be more reliable than the first one. On the contrary — it will probably be less valid.</p><p>Remember what a schedule is — a prediction. I have allowed myself in some cases to lowering time estimates in these “negotiations”, but it didn’t change how much time the task actually required. If, as a manager, you are asking for a lower time estimate, then you are saying the original estimate is wrong, and if you receive a revised prediction, whether it’s more or less to your liking, you should ask yourself why the revision is more believable than the original prediction.</p><p>Likewise, as a client, you may want to bargain down on price, but bargaining down the time estimate will just backfire on you — the project will take as long as it takes.</p><p>That doesn’t mean you cannot shorten the time for a project, but that means making reasoned tradeoff in features or resources. The right question to ask is “What can we do to get this project done earlier”</p><h2 id=\"schedule-suboptimally\">Schedule Suboptimally</h2><p>I used to have a terrible punctuality problem when I lived in Boston. Whenever an appointment time came around, I would tell myself I just need, say, fifteen minutes to drive down Memorial Drive along the Charles River to make a meeting around MIT. Invariably, after giving myself that fifteen minutes, I would still get started late, get bogged down in Boston traffic (sometimes I forgot to factor in the rush hour impedance). And then there was the time spent getting lost, if it was an unfamiliar meeting place, finding parking (certainly a high risk factor in Boston), and navigating the destination office building.</p><p>This planning could be charitably called “best-case” planning, but I think everyone would agree it’s a stupid way to schedule, especially after missing more than one meeting (including job interviews) by a wide margin. Nowadays, I’m much better at this — partly because I moved to California, but also because I do take in account how long these trips usually take, and I give myself some extra time in case traffic is slow or I have to stop for gas.</p><p>Software projects should be scheduled the same way. Look at how long it’s taken your group to do similar projects and add some safety time to take in account things that might happen. You don’t necessarily have to take in account worst-case scenarios — I don’t factor in potential three-hour freeway stoppages when I plan my outings, but they do happen once in a while. But do consider carefully how much risk is acceptible, a question that is de rigeur in other aspects of engineering.</p><h2 id=\"the-first-schedule-is-always-right\">The First Schedule is Always Right</h2><p>One consequence of making a distinction between the macro schedule and micro schedule is sticking to the initial macro schedule. The schedule you set down at the beginning of a project is most likely the correct schedule — you’re basing the delivery date on market considerations, expected budget, staffing and technology capability, and the beta, alpha and interim milestones all fall from that. At this point, you’re most free of wishful thinking influences — the schedule should be consistent with your experience from your own projects and others that this is a feasible schedule. Some things will take longer than expected, some shorter, but you’ll arrive at the expected time.</p><p>Three months into a a one year development schedule to port a 3D graphics application from Unix to Windows, I suffered several bouts of unwarranted optimism. The user interface system was basically up and running, and I told my boss I thought at this rate, I’d have the project done six months earlier. Fortunately, he didn’t tell anyone. With Windows idiosyncracies, graphics card issues, tracking ongoing changes from the Unix product line, and battling a compiler that was also in a “pre-alpha” stage, it wasn’t long before it was obvious we were exactly where the originally schedule said we’d be.</p><p>But no good deed goes unpunished. Once it appears your project won’t be a disaster, everyone who was keeping a healthy distance away will suddenly show up to “help”.</p><p>Ten months into a year-long crunch project, at the beginning of which it was wisely decided to pare features to enable a release by the next industry show, my boss suddenly wanted to put those features back in. He went around me (he knew what I would say) and asked some of the more optimistic and eager-to-please engineers to put in the features. After several days effort, I put my foot down and explained we already had a hundred and fifty bugs marked by QA as critical, and we could not afford the time to put in new features. “Oh, I didn’t know we had so many bugs,” was his lame acquiescence.</p><p>On a game project at a different company, the president tried to accerate the project by promising game delivery two months ahead of schedule. It seemed like things were going well, and finishing this project early would have let us get started on the next game, so I agreed, but once again, I was wrong. When we reached the revised deadline, we were just starting find all the bugs that had to be fixed, including extensive requirements by the console makers, whose approval we needed to distribute the game.</p><p>So we went back to the original schedule, but during the last week, once again, the president tried to advance the submission date by a couple of days. And once again, we didn’t make it. Worse, for every attempt to finish early, there was an extra flurry of activity, extra builds and late nights, that were essentially wasted our energy and sapped the momentum of the team. When you’re taking catnaps in your parked car during the day, you’re probably not producing quality work (especially if you own a compact car)</p><p>There will always be at least one point in the project where it seems like things are going better than expected.

I’ve got to have thirty minutes.” —\nScotty, in The Naked Time\nWhat is a Schedule?\nOn many projects I’ve been told there is no schedule — either as a complaint\n(“We don’t have a schedule!”) or boast (“We don’t have a schedule!”). But there\nis always a schedule, and you’ll find out what it was when you don’t meet it.\n\nDuring an interview with a prospective client, I was told “we’re not going to\nrelease this product until it’s ready.” Soon after I started working there, the\npresident of the company called an all-hands “come to Jesus” company meeting,\nwhere he yelled at everyone for not having the product finished several months\nago.\n\n“We won’t release the product until it’s ready” — famous last words. Only\nwell-funded and self-funded companies can really say it, mean it, and do it, and\nyou usually hear this said after a product misses it’s original release date.

Carmack is considered by many to be the best game programmer around and perhaps the best programmer, period. Romero, perhaps best remembered for his hubris-filled pronouncements to gamers, was considered a game design god by rabid game fans, before he was ousted from id and foundered at his next game venture, Ion Storm.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Kushner’s history of id mirrors the development of the PC game industry. id brought console-quality game performance to the PC, pioneered 3D graphics in games, popularized the first-person shooting genre, encouraged “modding” (customization of the game, to the extent of creating new levels and characters) and was at the center of the still-ongoing controversy over violence in games.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"After reading Kushner’s description of Carmack’s childhood isolation and run-ins with the law, and Romero’s abusive treatment at the hands of his stepfather, it seems that violence in video games is the result of youth violence rather than the cause. The success of the two in transcending their unhappy upbringing is gratifying, but the feeling is tempered by their immature and sometimes amoral behavior on their way up. Kushner’s depiction of id’s rowdy atmosphere, extended crunch times and political infighting brings to mind a combination of Revenge of the Nerds, Animal House and Lord of the Flies.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Irony abounds in this story. Romero, the visionary who first understood the implications of Carmack’s innovations and persuaded Carmack and their team members at SoftDisk to jump ship and start id, had ambitious plans for turning id into a vast gaming empire, but it was Carmack the introverted and ascetic programmer who ended up controlling the direction of the company. Just as the id group had abrubtly abandoned SoftDisk, so did Romero’s team at Ion Storm walk out on him. And while the split between Carmack and Romero was partly fueled by their technlogy-centric versus design-centric debate, eventually Romero turned to developing games on technologically constrained cell phones and PDA’s, while Carmack’s ultimate goal of approximating a Star Trek holodeck experience was stymied by his game designers.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"As with many successful game titles, Kushner’s work is thoroughly entertaining, but not without some minor distracting glitches. Some of the technical history is not quite right, e.g. Carmack did not convert Quake 2 to run on the OpenGL graphics library so that it would run on graphics cards from 3dfx, as the book states. On the contrary, 3dfx had inadequate OpenGL support at the time, so Carmack implemented a subset of OpenGL called “QuakeGL” for 3dfx in order to get the game running on that hardware. This effort and his strongly-state preference for OpenGL over other graphics libraries at the time attests to Carmack’s programming prowess and also his sense of hacker purity, which the author does convey clearly.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"The reader might not obtain a correct sense of proportion from this book.

I thought that sounded like a pretty good lifestyle, and these days I can tell people are similarly intrigued when they ask me about my consulting business. It sounds appealing — be your own boss, make your own hours, pick your own projects, and get paid more than you made as a salary. But don’t be misled by the fancy-sounding title “consultant”. Sometimes it means just working on a contract basis, and sometimes it’s a euphemism for being in-between jobs.</p><p>In fact, as a consultant, I earn less on average than I did from a salary, there are long gaps between paying projects (when I first began telling people I was an independent consultant, I felt like I was lying), and some years I qualify for the low-income discount from the utility companies. But I have time for my own projects between contracts, I find the nitty-gritty of running my own business interesting and educational, and (perhaps this is my imagination) I receive more courteous and professional treatment as a contractor and consultant than I did as an employee.</p><p>So if this lifestyle still sounds appealing, read on…</p><h2 id=\"get-ready\">Get Ready</h2><p>Consulting can be very unsteady work, so you shouldn’t rely on it as a living if you don’t have a good cash reserve. In general, I’ve heard that you should have six months of living expenses saved up in case of unemployment. For a consultant, I think you should have at least a year’s reserve.</p><p>When I first started relying entirely on consulting work for income, I figured that I had six months of living expenses in reserve. Six months later, I realized I was right on schedule.</p><p>If you had employer-sponsored health insurance, be sure to continue that coverage under COBRA until it expires or you have found other insurance. Under federal law, you’re entitled to health insurance as long as you’ve taken full advantage of COBRA, but if you neglect to sign up or you discontinue the coverage early, you could be out of luck — insurers are not then required to grant you a new policy. Companies with real HR departments usually know what they’re doing, but some small companies play fast and loose with the rules, so don’t can’t assume they’ll do the right thing.</p><p>I’ve been in a couple of startups that didn’t seem aware of their health care obligations — one completely ignored my queries about signing up for COBRA, and after the decision period expired I received a letter from the insurer stating that I was no longer eligible. At the other, the owner expressed surprise when I pointed out that California extends COBRA rules to small companies via CalCOBRA, and then gave me a waiver to sign ignoring the allowable decision period.</p><p>It’s unfortunate that the U.S. health care system relies on employers to provide affordable health insurance, but given that, it’s important for you to understand the laws that are there for your protection and to take advantage of them.</p><h2 id=\"get-paid\">Get Paid</h2><p>Always get paid. With money. You may get offered equity, royalties or the reward of an experience, but take those in account only after discussing cash compensation.</p><p>I was offered a tiny equity stake and no cash to consult for a startup. A year later, the founders asked everyone for the stock certificates back so they could dissolve the company.</p><p>If the client is certain about making money off the project, he should put his money where his mouth is and pay you now. And if the prospects are more dubious, he should definitely pay you. Either way, there’s no reason you should take the risk.</p><p>In some cases, a client will try to renegotiate terms after the fact. In the worst cases, like an old apartment roommate of mine who just assumed I would cover his rent, I’ve had a few clients who expected me to continue working on their projects even when they stopped paying me.</p><p>A game publisher that hired me to evaluate builds from one of their developers terminated the contract, then a month later sent me a new build to evaluate. When I asked if this meant they wanted to restart the contract, the reply was: “Oh, we thought you could just look at it.” But at least they paid. When I informed another client that our contract period was up, they said, “now this is the transition period”, expecting me to supply free support while they dithered around with the contract renewal. The worst transgressor in my experience was a game developer who hired me to help finish the “first-playable” build of a game and told me that that it would absolutely be delivered in five weeks or “there wouldn’t be a company anymore.” After six weeks, when I asked if they wanted me to continue, the reply was “it’s entirely up to you.” Apparently there was an implicit “but we won’t pay”, since the invoice I submitted a few weeks later was met with the classic denial-blame-bargaining phases of weaseling out of a bill. Ironically, that developer had a history of threatening and suing any publishers who tried the same trick on them.</p><p>You shouldn’t have to do this, but be crystal clear that you expect to be paid. Avoid deadbeats. Check your network — few companies have pristine reputations, but some are repeat offenders, to the point where they effectively have bad credit and contractors won’t deal with them. Don’t take “…because of our financial situation…” for an excuse. (I did on one occasion just so I wouldn’t have to listen to any more whining, but righteousness is expensive) If they can’t pay their debts, they should declare bankruptcy. Any client that wants to be treated as a charity should reincorporate as one.</p><h2 id=\"wait-til-the-check-clears\">Wait ‘til the Check Clears</h2><p>As a teenager in Iowa, a bus driver noticed I’d tried to get on with a few cents short of full fare and gave me a succinct lecture: “if you don’t have enough, just tell me.” I wish he could set some of my clients straight. In my experience, most clients do pay up, but when they’re having trouble coming up with the money, they don’t tell me what’s really going on.</p><p>For eight months I had no problem submitting invoices to a particular client until one day the accounts guy who’d processed of all my previous invoices asked “Do you have authorization for this?”. The next time I tried to submit an invoice, that guy was gone and another person directed me to drop the invoice off in a nearby office — an empty office. It was no surprise when I inquired about it six weeks later that they had no record of it. But that was better than the company whose office flunky took my invoice and then went to Taiwan for a long vacation. Or the company who told me they couldn’t complete the check because “the girl who does that is manning the switchboard right now”. I mean, really.</p><p>When you start getting “the dog ate my homework” excuse, it’s time to wrap it up. And don’t spend any of that money until the check clears.</p><h2 id=\"don-t-sell-yourself-short\">Don’t Sell Yourself Short</h2><p>As a rule, a contract rate should be higher than a salaried rate. Prospective clients that act surprised at that are either disingenuous or not too bright. Remember, the client isn’t providing you employee benefits such as health insurance and training, paying your employment tax, or paying you severance when the contract is terminated (unless you have negotiated it). You have to cover your own insurance costs, pay a fifteen percent self-employment tax in addition to regular income tax, keep yourself up-to-date and marketable, oftentimes provide your own equipment and facilities, and cover your living expenses in the periods between contracts.</p><p>Availability of contracts is largely a matter of timing. When business is good, that means you’ll have to turn down some projects while you’re occupied with others. Taking a low-paying contract may mean you’ll passing up a higher-paying contract in the meantime — you’re paying an “opportunity cost”.</p><p>During just one year, I missed out on at least three potential contracts because I was busy on others. In one case, I passed on a one-month full-rate job that would have paid twice more in total than the lower-rate two-month project that had my attention at the time. There were some other considerations on the lower-paying project that hopefully made it worthwhile, but it’s hard not to feel regret when you’ve traded off that much income.</p><p>Longer-term contracts don’t necessarily justify lower rates. A contractor friend of mine told me when I started out that companies can terminate a contract at any time, and you just have to factor that into your price. And indeed I’ve found that to be true — most clients will have no compunction about terminating a contract if the funding falls through, or if they think they can get someone cheaper to do it.</p><p>One client pouted that it wouldn’t make sense for her if I didn’t stay on project for the duration, expected to be another year or so. The entire project was cancelled a few weeks later, and I didn’t even get paid for all of that. I have to say, that didn’t make sense for me.</p><p>It’s unfortunate that some clients will stoop to haggling like car salesmen (“I’m writing down a number….”).</p><p>I had one client who not only bargained down my rate (“that’s more than I make!”, he exclaimed), but also wanted payments tied to milestones, ostensibly as as formality. And every couple of weeks, they had just one more favor to ask, until, by the second contract renewal, they were cramming as many listed but unspecified deliverables as they could into the schedule on a weekly basis without even making payments for each deliverable, and trying to sneak in unpaid “transition” periods of work between contract renewals.</p><p>If a client acts cheap before the contract even starts, it’s just going to get worse. Phrases to watch out for: “We’re on a budget”, “This should be easy”, and, my favorite: “I would do it myself, but I don’t have time.” Avoid these projects — it’s not worth the aggravation. Make Your Reputation</p><p>Every project you get is a potential link to your next one. One executive-level consultant told me he used to try marketing himself aggressively, handing out business cards at networking parties, etc, but all of his work came out of his existing network. This has been true in my case, too — all of my contract work (and many of my salaried jobs) have come through referrals.</p><p>So it is important to maintain and enhance your reputation on each project. This includes getting quality work done, and managing expectations.</p><p>I’ve heard complaints from clients about having to throw away work performed by previous contractors just because no one could understand their code. And I’ve heard of contractors who will actually offer one rate to do a quick and dirty job, and a higher rate to do clean code with good documentation. That shouldn’t be a choice — do the job right and be honest about how much it will cost and how long it will take, even if it’s not what the client wants to hear.</p><p>Besides good work, you also want a reputation for billing fairly and not trying to milk each project.

The worst transgressor in my experience was a\ngame developer who hired me to help finish the “first-playable” build of a game\nand told me that that it would absolutely be delivered in five weeks or “there\nwouldn’t be a company anymore.” After six weeks, when I asked if they wanted me\nto continue, the reply was “it’s entirely up to you.” Apparently there was an\nimplicit “but we won’t pay”, since the invoice I submitted a few weeks later was\nmet with the classic denial-blame-bargaining phases of weaseling out of a bill.\nIronically, that developer had a history of threatening and suing any publishers\nwho tried the same trick on them.\n\nYou shouldn’t have to do this, but be crystal clear that you expect to be paid.\nAvoid deadbeats. Check your network — few companies have pristine reputations,\nbut some are repeat offenders, to the point where they effectively have bad\ncredit and contractors won’t deal with them. Don’t take “…because of our\nfinancial situation…” for an excuse. (I did on one occasion just so I wouldn’t\nhave to listen to any more whining, but righteousness is expensive) If they\ncan’t pay their debts, they should declare bankruptcy. Any client that wants to\nbe treated as a charity should reincorporate as one.\n\nWait ‘til the Check Clears\nAs a teenager in Iowa, a bus driver noticed I’d tried to get on with a few cents\nshort of full fare and gave me a succinct lecture: “if you don’t have enough,\njust tell me.” I wish he could set some of my clients straight. In my\nexperience, most clients do pay up, but when they’re having trouble coming up\nwith the money, they don’t tell me what’s really going on.\n\nFor eight months I had no problem submitting invoices to a particular client\nuntil one day the accounts guy who’d processed of all my previous invoices asked\n“Do you have authorization for this?”. The next time I tried to submit an\ninvoice, that guy was gone and another person directed me to drop the invoice\noff in a nearby office — an empty office. It was no surprise when I inquired\nabout it six weeks later that they had no record of it. But that was better than\nthe company whose office flunky took my invoice and then went to Taiwan for a\nlong vacation. Or the company who told me they couldn’t complete the check\nbecause “the girl who does that is manning the switchboard right now”. I mean,\nreally.\n\nWhen you start getting “the dog ate my homework” excuse, it’s time to wrap it\nup. And don’t spend any of that money until the check clears.\n\nDon’t Sell Yourself Short\nAs a rule, a contract rate should be higher than a salaried rate. Prospective\nclients that act surprised at that are either disingenuous or not too bright.\nRemember, the client isn’t providing you employee benefits such as health\ninsurance and training, paying your employment tax, or paying you severance when\nthe contract is terminated (unless you have negotiated it). You have to cover\nyour own insurance costs, pay a fifteen percent self-employment tax in addition\nto regular income tax, keep yourself up-to-date and marketable, oftentimes\nprovide your own equipment and facilities, and cover your living expenses in the\nperiods between contracts.\n\nAvailability of contracts is largely a matter of timing. When business is good,\nthat means you’ll have to turn down some projects while you’re occupied with\nothers. Taking a low-paying contract may mean you’ll passing up a higher-paying\ncontract in the meantime — you’re paying an “opportunity cost”.\n\nDuring just one year, I missed out on at least three potential contracts because\nI was busy on others. In one case, I passed on a one-month full-rate job that\nwould have paid twice more in total than the lower-rate two-month project that\nhad my attention at the time. There were some other considerations on the\nlower-paying project that hopefully made it worthwhile, but it’s hard not to\nfeel regret when you’ve traded off that much income.\n\nLonger-term contracts don’t necessarily justify lower rates. A contractor friend\nof mine told me when I started out that companies can terminate a contract at\nany time, and you just have to factor that into your price. And indeed I’ve\nfound that to be true — most clients will have no compunction about terminating\na contract if the funding falls through, or if they think they can get someone\ncheaper to do it.\n\nOne client pouted that it wouldn’t make sense for her if I didn’t stay on\nproject for the duration, expected to be another year or so. The entire project\nwas cancelled a few weeks later, and I didn’t even get paid for all of that. I\nhave to say, that didn’t make sense for me.\n\nIt’s unfortunate that some clients will stoop to haggling like car salesmen\n(“I’m writing down a number….”).\n\nI had one client who not only bargained down my rate (“that’s more than I\nmake!”, he exclaimed), but also wanted payments tied to milestones, ostensibly\nas as formality. And every couple of weeks, they had just one more favor to ask,\nuntil, by the second contract renewal, they were cramming as many listed but\nunspecified deliverables as they could into the schedule on a weekly basis\nwithout even making payments for each deliverable, and trying to sneak in unpaid\n“transition” periods of work between contract renewals.\n\nIf a client acts cheap before the contract even starts, it’s just going to get\nworse. Phrases to watch out for: “We’re on a budget”, “This should be easy”,\nand, my favorite: “I would do it myself, but I don’t have time.” Avoid these\nprojects — it’s not worth the aggravation. Make Your Reputation\n\nEvery project you get is a potential link to your next one. One executive-level\nconsultant told me he used to try marketing himself aggressively, handing out\nbusiness cards at networking parties, etc, but all of his work came out of his\nexisting network. This has been true in my case, too — all of my contract work\n(and many of my salaried jobs) have come through referrals.\n\nSo it is important to maintain and enhance your reputation on each project. This\nincludes getting quality work done, and managing expectations.\n\nI’ve heard complaints from clients about having to throw away work performed by\nprevious contractors just because no one could understand their code. And I’ve\nheard of contractors who will actually offer one rate to do a quick and dirty\njob, and a higher rate to do clean code with good documentation. That shouldn’t\nbe a choice — do the job right and be honest about how much it will cost and how\nlong it will take, even if it’s not what the client wants to hear.\n\nBesides good work, you also want a reputation for billing fairly and not trying\nto milk each project. I’ve seen contractors bill the maximum allowable hours no\nmatter how much they actually work, and contractors who try to extract every\nlittle perk and expense reimbursement, down to free sodas and per diems. This\nmakes contract negotatiation harder for everyone. Forget the small stuff — it’s\nthe big payment that counts, and if you have a reputation for billing fairly,\nit’s easier to maintain a higher rate.\n\nAnd most of all, don’t make the person who referred you regret the decision.\n\nOne programmer I introduced to a game developer embarrassed me by being overly\ninquisitive and pushing aggressively for a demo. Another artist I introduced to\na potential client kept probing me for inside information while negotiating a\ncontract. (and meanwhile the client was doing the same. What a headache) I’ll\nnever refer those guys again — too much damn trouble.\n\nIf employment is like a marriage (or at least a steady relationship), then\ncontract work is like prostitution. And I don’t mean that in a bad way.\n\nI worked with one contractor who emailed the whole company calling for everyone\nto strike in support of better conditions for the office cleaning people.\nWell-intentioned, but I doubt even the cleaning staff was going to rally around\nhim.\n\nThe most important thing in the contract relationship is that you get paid. As a\nmercenary, you can offer friendly suggestions about how your clients run their\nbusinesses, but it’s their business.\n\nPut the “Contract” in “Contractor”\nMy least favorite part of contract work is the contract itself. The conventional\nwisdom is “Get it in writing”. If someone is going to cheat you, they’re not\ngoing to let a piece of paper stop them, but it doesn’t hurt to have something\nthat you can fall back on in the event of legal recourse, and even for\n“handshake” agreements, people can have different memories of even the basic\nterms, so you want to get that written down in some form.\n\nTypically, the client will present you with a contract put together by the\nclient’s attorneys, who are solely representing the client’s interests. It’s up\nto you to protect your interests. So don’t get bullied into accepting any terms\nthat make you uncomfortable.\n\nStatements you should ignore:\n\n“This contract is intended to protect your interests.” Bah! The company’s\nattorneys are bound to represent their clients’ interests, and that does not\ninclude you. Go ahead and ask the company’s lawyers if they are representing\nyour interests.\n\n“No one has complained about this before.” That’s probably not true, and if it\nis, it means they didn’t read it carefully or bother to have their own lawyer\nlook at it.\n\n“I have to protect my company’s interests.” So what? You have to protect yours.\nLifelong servitude and your first-born child would be in your client’s\ninterests, but that doesn’t make it reasonable.\n\nSometimes it’s hard to get a clause removed just by asking, so one tactic I’ve\ntaken is to make sure the clause goes both ways. After all, the contract is\nbetween two business entities, so it should be fairly symmetric.\n\nWhen faced with a non-poaching clause that stated if I “encouraged” any of their\nemployees or contractors to leave the company within a year of the contract’s\nduration, the penalty would be $100,000 or a year’s salary of the employee, I\nasked that the clause apply both ways (hey, I could use $100k!). The clause was\nconspicuously absent in the next draft of the contract.\n\nJust because the contract was put together by an attorney doesn’t mean that it’s\nworth the paper it’s printed on. As with doctors and automobile mechanics, it’s\neasy to assume lawyers know what they’re talking about. But sometimes they do,\nand sometimes they don’t.\n\nAn in-house counsel for VC-funded startup assured me that the indemnification\nclause in my contract had nothing to do with financial liability. When I\ninsisted that “indemnify” meant “to pay”, she looked it up in her pocket\ndictionary and had to agree. But I guess she hadn’t authored that clause — I\nlater found a word-for-word copy of the contract on a sample-contract web site.\n\nAnother piece of conventional wisdom is to have your own attorney look at your\ncontract. But attorneys are expensive. In general, I don’t bother with an\nattorney if the contract looks straightforward, especially if the contract is\nsmall. If there’s anything that is not clear to you, you should definitely have\nan attorney look it over (or walk away if the contract pay is too small to\nwarrant the contract hassle and legal fees). But as before, keep in mind that\nnot all attorneys are created equal:\n\nAn attorney I picked out of the yellow pages (I was in a hurry) to review a game\ndevelopment contract gave me pause when he referred to “newfangled” video games.\nHe did provide some useful information and corrected mispellings in the contract\n(I am constantly amazed how someone charging $300 an hour to put together a\ncontract doesn’t bother to run a spell-checker on it). But I would have felt\nmore secure with someone that had knowledge of the industry.\n\nIf you get an attorney, find one who is capable and knowledgable in your\nindustry. And pass the name on to me! Keep Busy\n\nIn between projects, you may be inclined to panic. If you do, you’re probably\nnot cut out for this business. Downtime is an opportunity to catch up on things\nthat may be neglected while you’re busy on paying work.\n\nYou can keep yourself up to date by attending technical presentations,\nconferences and trade shows. It’s an opportunity to see the latest products and\ntechnologies, and perhaps investigate new areas in which you can work.\n\nI like to go out of town for an industry show after wrapping up a big project —\nusually the more stressful the project, the farther I like to travel. It’s a\nnice opportunity to unwind, get away from the computer for a few days, and see\nwhat I’ve been missing the last several months. I usually look for shows with\nfree expo passes rather than pay for a full conference registration (not for any\ngood reason besides being cheap). Watch out for spam, though. I’ve been\nunsubscribing from CMP missives for years, now.\n\nYou can participate in technical discussion groups. It’s an opportunity to toss\naround ideas, identify people you might want to work with (particularly in local\narea groups), and help out people who might help you someday.\n\nI’ve kept up with the many interesting developments in Java and Java-based\nprojects by following the local (Orange County and Los Angeles) Java User Group\nmail lists. I don’t particularly like sitting in meetings, so I eschew the\nregularly-scheduled presentations, but the discussions are often illuminating,\nand they keep me informed of the latest promising tools. I even brought in one\ngroup member as a co-contractor on a project.\n\nYou can contribute to open source projects. It’s an opportunity to communicate\nwith some excellent developers around the world, research open source tools that\nyou may find useful, and give back to the community.\n\nDuring my first time off, I made some fixes to JFOR, an XSL/FO-to-RTF converter,\nso I could use it to generate Word-readable versions of my resume from an XML\nFormat. Since then, I’ve decided recruiters and HR people should know how to\nread and cut-and-paste from PDF, so I don’t use JFOR, anymore, but I’m gratified\nto see once in a while an acknowledgment of my contributions from the JFOR list.\n\nWith all of these activities, the idea is to improve your capabilities and\nmarketability, expand your network and establish some street cred, and enjoy\nyourself in the meantime!","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2021-03-01T05:17:47.000Z","updated_at":"2021-10-24T20:39:09.000Z","published_at":"2021-03-01T05:18:51.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null},{"id":"603c7f70e61660003926708d","uuid":"999ccc8f-bd75-40bc-a703-553e48a0b131","title":"Who Knew Texans Were So Deep?","slug":"who-knew-texans-were-so-deep","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lone_Star_(1996_film)\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"My criterion for a five-star movie rating is the desire to watch it over and over again.

Otherwise, there is no reason to believe that at some point during execution of the new plan that you won’t change your mind again.</p><h3 id=\"stop-pulling-the-fire-alarm\">Stop Pulling the Fire Alarm</h3><p>Left to their own devices, management will often manufacture emergencies.

In either case, after raising some dust and getting some crunch time work, the bosses feel mightily pleased with themselves.</p><p>But an emergency indicates a failure in planning, and repeated emergencies will cause your staff to either leave or treat the emergencies as a joke (chances are you’ll have both results — your more motivated staffers will leave and the less active ones will stay).

The only rationale I could see is that she would selectively bring up those cases when someone agreed with her to buttress her decisions later. But it would have saved a lot of time and argument if she had just made the decisions she was going to make anyway.</blockquote><p>Of course, you shouldn’t ignore good input from employees — just don’t ask for an opinion if you don’t want it. The most useless area to ask about is your own performance. It’s like asking “Do these jeans make me look fat?”</p><blockquote>When I worked on the Hubble Space Telescope, I got into a dispute with a project lead who had made changes to my code when I was on vacation. He was unable to tell me exactly what those changes were, so I refused to integrate them. Offended, he asked me, “Don’t you trust me to make those changes?” Now, why did he have to ask that?</blockquote><h3 id=\"stop-whining\">Stop Whining</h3><p>Yes, being the boss is hard. But no one cares.</p><blockquote>One of my more narcissistic bosses practiced management by self-pity: “I never would have started this company if I’d known how hard this is.” “Do you want to trade places?” “I know your point of view, but you don’t know mine.” “I kept all my promises and everyone else broke theirs.” Believe me, it gets old after a few months, not to mention several years. This person even expected her employees to feel sorry for her whenever she terminated one of them.</blockquote><p>Everyone is guilty to of some rationalization and self-delusion, but people who actually want to boss others around tend to be guiltier than most. (Hint: if you spend a lot of time thinking about how you’re a good guy, you’re probably not) One abrasive company president often complained to me how she’d be treated differently if she was a man. A departing employee confirmed that, remarking “if she was a guy I would have punched her by now”.</p><p>I enjoy working with managers who frankly discuss problems, but there’s a difference between entertaining gripes and whining self-pity. If being in charge is really so unpleasant, quit and do something useful. If you feel unappreciated, tell it to your therapist. And if you’re really narcissistic — well, you probably don’t realize this section is about you.</p><h3 id=\"pick-something\">Pick Something</h3><p>Real leadership involves making the tough decisions. If you can’t make those decisions, then, as I rather bluntly told a manager once — what do we need you for? The first choices to make are in prioritizing, and everything has to be prioritized — features, bug fixes, delivery dates, customers, hiring, buying equipment, and so on.</p><blockquote>At one company where I was maintaining a Unix application while porting it to Windows, the president of the company told me the number one priority was to get the PC product out. When I asked him what about the Unix product, he thought a bit and said, “that’s the highest priority, too”. Thanks a lot, that’s really useful!</blockquote><p>Understandably, managers like to keep their options open. Sometimes this manifests as a refusal to make decisions early in the project, or a convenient amnesia regarding past decisions later in the project (you know this is going to happen when decisions are not written down). This strategy is as rewarding as setting up your retirement account just before your retire.</p><h2 id=\"lead-by-example\">Lead By Example</h2><p>No matter how well-written the employee handbook or how well-produced the corporate video, it is management behavior that sets the tone of the corporate culture. “Do as I say, not as I do” works great if you’re satisifed with a mediocre organization or if you rule by fear. But if you want a high-quality group and you’re not Stalin, you have to lead by example:</p><h3 id=\"be-realistic\">Be Realistic</h3><p>The biggest management disease is wishful thinking.</p><blockquote>One Vader-like CEO intoned to me “This is the last time. You just have to take my word for it”, when one of our helpful integration engineers insisted we had to deliver new features immediately after an official release. That assurance was as convincing as “this is my last drink”. And it turned out to be just as valid.</blockquote><p>Do the right thing now.</p><h3 id=\"be-responsible\">Be Responsible</h3><p>If there’s one common skill among managers, it’s self-promotion. And self-preservation (well, that’s two, but they come as a package).</p><blockquote>When I worked on one defense simulation project that looked doomed, I noticed the head of the department stayed a healthy distance away from the lab, for several months. But just a week before the deadline, when it looked like we were actually going to pull this project off, he showed up in the lab glowing with enthusiasm and optimism.</blockquote><p>If you expect your people to put themselves on the line, you have to stick you neck out a little, too. One of my more annoying bosses liked to go around telling people “I’m holding you responsible” but whined “Now everyone’s going to blame me” whenever she screwed up.</p><p>Everyone makes mistakes. At least if you ‘fess up, you’ll have the respect of your employees, and maybe, just maybe, they’ll take responsibility for their work, too. It may not be the best corporate politics, and maybe you’ll have to adjust your self image, but it’s good leadership.</p><blockquote>I worked for one director of engineering who readily admitted her mistakes although she could easily have blamed all problems on our dysfunctional software development group. When a rogue engineer pushed ahead with his own release (and his own agenda, to curry favor with the client) independently of the rest of the project, creating more work and more grief for everyone else, this director admitted almost immediately that it was a bad decision on her part to let him do it.</blockquote><p>On another project where it turned out there was an embarassing flaw in the demo release — the director of software could easily have blamed a number of parties, ranging from employees to vendors, but he simply stated that it was a collective failure, we had to focus on a solution and fix the process to avoid similar problems in the future.</p><p>If you make it clear you’ve learned from experience, maybe everyone else will. They’ll follow you with more confidence, instead of fatalism. And if you accept responsibility for mistakes matter-of-factly, instead of in some torturous sequence of denial and blame, then maybe everyone else will do the same and get on with the real work.</p><blockquote>One of my bosses seemed to expect a Nobel Prize every time she admitted to a mistake. Months later, it would be the subject of lore — “Remember I took responsibility for that? Remember?”</blockquote><p>I’ve seen some leadership advice saying you should never apologize. I don’t really agree with that, but an insincere apology is worse than none at all.</p><p>One of my favorites pseudo-apologies: “It’s my fault for hiring that person.” A feeble show of responsibility while directing the blame at someone else.</p><h3 id=\"be-professional\">Be Professional</h3><p>Professionalism is underrated. Companies sometimes brag about how much fun they have and how they’re one big happy family, but parties can only last so long, and how many families actually want to work together?</p><blockquote>I had one boss who liked to admonish her employees to “please be professional”. Which is one of the more annoying things one can say, like “don’t be an ass”. It was also an ironic thing to say, since her management repertoire included whining, yelling, foot-stomping, tossing items on employee’s desks and terminating conversations by abruptly turning around and leaving.</blockquote><p>You shouldn’t have to like all your coworkers to have a decent job. (That would really limit your options) As with politeness, professionalism can make bad situations tolerable and make good situations last longer.</p><blockquote>The aforementioned employer told me she didn’t care if departing employees had resentful feelings about their jobs, and then in the same conversation she wondered how to keep ex-employees from spreading a bad reputation for her company. Apparently, she didn’t see the link.</blockquote><p>Typically, even inept and slimy employers will be smooth when easing employees out the door. “Glad to have you, sorry it didn’t work out.”</p><h3 id=\"be-fair\">Be Fair</h3><p>Don’t be fooled by seeing all those warm bodies in the cubicles staying late in the day — they’re not necessarily working (the Internet is a wonderful thing), and there’s sure to be a stampede for the exit once the boss’s car leaves the parking lot.</p><p>But employees might conscientiously put in the effort if they see that effort from you.</p><blockquote>On one tightly-scheduled porting project, I was responsible for the bulk of the code and consequently spent the first few months working eighty-hours weeks. I didn’t get much assistance from outside the group, but I was greatly appreciative when the other members witnessed my long hours and offered to help in any way they could.</blockquote><p>In particular, if you expect people to go above and beyond the call of duty and give up their personal time, you’d better show you’re willing to make the same sacrifice.</p><blockquote>I’ve been on more than one project where the manager, just before going to the gym, would tell everyone to stay late at work. One manager asked me to wait for her in the office after hours until her aerobics class finished — upon return she ignored me another half hour until I finally asked what she wanted to talk about. “I just wanted to tell you you’re doing a good job.” Wow, that was worth skipping dinner.</blockquote><p>The message — my time is more important than yours. Now get back to work.</p>","comment_id":"603d0214e61660003926709d","plaintext":"> I have people skills; I am good at dealing with people. Can’t you understand\nthat? What the hell is wrong with you people? — Tom Smykowski\nOffice Space\nKnow Your Stuff\nThe saying goes, those who can’t do, teach. The same could be said of\nmanagement. (And those who can’t manage, consult? But let’s leave that for\nanother essay…) In any case, I’ve often complained long and bitterly about\nsoftware project management, and a coworker once responded, “Phil, you’re always\nright”. I don’t know if he was serious, but in the spirit of that encouraging or\nsarcastic endorsement, here are my recommended practices for managing software\nprojects.\n\nIn many cases, “project manager” is a Microsoft Project manager whose apparent\nsole responsibility is to maintain a Gantt chart. (Sometimes even that is too\nadvanced — I’ve sat in meetings watching people fumble with an Excel\nspreadsheet) But there’s got to be more to project management, or any idiot\ncould do it.\n\nKnow the Technology\nThe best way to gain the respect of your engineering staff is to understand the\ntechnology they’re using. This isn’t the same as thinking you understand. A\nlittle knowledge is a dangerous thing, especially the latest knowledge gleaned\nfrom buzzword-laden articles in business magazines.\n\n> At an early stage on one large application runing in Lisp, I mentioned to my\nboss that I thought garbage collection was causing some performance problems.\nFrom then on, every time he saw a slowdown, he’d ponder, “hmm, looks like\ngarbage collection.”\nAs a manager, it’s unlikely that you know more about everything than everyone on\nyour team, even if you’re the chief high tech mucky muck of your organization.\nSo take the opportunity to learn from your people.\n\n> I have a friend who graduated with a PhD from a well-regarded computer science\ndepartment and yet was treated to an impromptu lecture on computer simulation\nfrom his company’s president, who had lesser engineering credentials from over a\ndecade ago. Not surprisingly, my friend was rather offended.\nWorse is when your lack of expertise causes you to miss problems in the project\ndesign and execution.\n\n> As a technical lead on supply chain management software, I correctly chose XML\n(these were the early days of XML) as a platform-neutral format for our fab\nscheduling system, but didn’t learn enough about XML until after the project was\ndelivered to realize that we didn’t do a very good job of sticking to XML (e.g.\nno DTD). Too bad — this was back when XML was pretty new stuff, so if I’d really\nknown what I was doing, maybe I could have defined an industry standard format\nfor semiconductor fab automation.\nMaster Your Domain\nEven if you don’t know much about the engineering aspects of your project,\nyou’ll have value and get some respect if you know the application domain.\n\n> Representing a computer graphics software company, I visited one of our tool\nvendors and gave them an impromptu demo with the intent of getting them excited\nabout supporting our product. Unfortunately, I couldn’t figure out what more to\ndo after creating a cube and making it spin. Should have rehearsed, I guess.\nKnowledge of your application domain is important in designing a useful product,\nsupporting your customers, and avoiding embarrassment.\n\nKnow Management\nYou should also be familiar with the state of the art in software project\nmanagement.\n\nIf there’s one classic textbook on software engineering, it’s Fred Brook’s The\nMythical Man Month, and if there’s one classic software engineering principle\nanyone remembers from that book, it’s the rule that adding more engineers to a\nlate project just slows it down. I don’t know if anyone I’ve ever worked for has\nread that book, but I have been on more than one project where panicked\nmanagement piled on additional staff.\n\nOf course, software engineering is just as trend-filled as other engineering\nfields (TQA, Six Sigma, ISO 9000…), and over-hyping is the rule, but you can’t\nintelligently discuss practices and choose among them and apply them without\nreading up on them first. And if you don’t know management stuff, what do you\nbring to the table — charisma? You’re just an engineer who’s not doing any\nengineering.\n\nGood Management is Risk Management\nThe most crucial aspect of project management is risk management. Every decision\nmade in a project should be weighed against how much risk it adds to the delay\nor failure of the project.\n\nIf I Had a Nickel….\nI’ve often joked that every feature request should be accompanied by a dollar,\nbut I betcha if managers had to whip out their own billfold and pull out a\ndollar for those “important” requests, the feature set would shrink\ndramatically.\n\n> I was working on a submarine simulator that, up to that point,only had\nnavigation controls. When our manager said he wanted to fire a torpedo for\ntomorrow’s demo, we hastily improvised a reasonable facsimile. Encouraged by\nthat, the manager innocently asked ten minutes before the demo whether he could\nfire a cruise missile. One of my coworkers grabbed him and pulled him out of the\nroom before I could say anything.\nThere is no free lunch — everything has a cost, but it’s usually felt by the\npoor slob who ends up working the weekend rather than the person in management\nor marketing who belatedly said “we really need this”.\n\nScotty Doesn’t Work Here\nI blame Star Trek. Aliens are always humanoid and speak English, and the\noffworld females find Kirk irresistable — no one believes that’s the stuff of\nreality. But the last fifteen minutes of every episode where Scotty or Geordi\njury-rigs an engineering solution based on a never-tested hypothesis, and it\nalways works just in time to avert disaster.\n\n> I knew I was in a Star Trek moment on a military distributed interactive\nsimulation project (basically a big multiplayer video game) when the project\nmanager actually referred to me as “Geordi”. Sitting in front of a mock\nsubmarine console, wearing submarine coveralls while the PR cameras rolled and\nNavy VIP’s watched, I pushed the “start simulation” button that would connect us\nwith the entire wide-area networked simulation and watched the system core dump\nas it got flooded with packets from the rest of the exercise. The project\nmanager calmly informed everyone that we had “technical difficulties” and to\n“stand down”, while I tried not to puke. I fixed the problem in the standard\nepisode final fifteen minutes by deciding we didn’t really care what anyone else\nwas doing and turning off our system’s data read from the outside world.\nThis project had the all the makings of a disaster — I cooled my heels for two\nmonths waiting for a security clearance, the networking hardware was two months\nlate (it was a seven month project with a hard deadline), the laboratory had no\nexperience on this type of project, and one of the three engineers working on\nthe project didn’t do anything (but amazingly kept repeating “I’ll have it done\ntomorrow” for months). And then I spent the last month of the project working\nwhile flu-ridden. Our participation in the exercise was hailed as a success\n(evident when all the senior managers who had kept a healthy distance away\nsuddenly show up), but I don’t think I could physically take any more successes\nlike that.\n\nIn real life, the Starship Enterprise would blow up every time — the\nepisode-saving idea would be faulty, or Scotty (or Geordi or whoever, depending\non which series you watch) is out sick, the warp core isn’t performing up to\nspec, Jean-Luc didn’t get the memo, etc. Depending on programmer heroics to pull\nyou through the crunch time, and even worse, building such a crunch time into\nthe schedule, is a recipe for disaster. It’s fun to remember the successes, but\nthe result is usually failure.\n\nGet That Fresh and Clean Feeling\nMake sure you build the product regularly and from scratch. A common practice is\nto do this as an automated nightly build. If you don’t do it, then you never\nknow if you can really do it.\n\n> A group developing software for use with the Hubble Space Telescope decided to\nrebuild the currently-deployed version a a reference for our research in\ndesigning the next version. But the previous build had been made years ago, and\nthere had been enough VMS Fortran compiler changes that the old software didn’t\ncompile anymore. If we actually had to fix a bug in the old software anytime in\nthe past few years, we would have been out of luck.\nIt’s no exaggeration to say that the fate of your company could depend on the\nability to make a clean build. One tool vendor I used to work with went Chapter\n11 and at least one rescue acquisition failed because they couldn’t demonstrate\na successful clean build from the source code.\n\nHaving a regular automated build proves that you have a functioning build\nprocedure set down in a script, not dependent on some sequence of magical\nincantations resident in one build engineer’s head.\n\nLet the Code Set\nI’ve never seen a code freeze really frozen to my satisfaction — there’s always\ntemptation to keep adding “just one more thing” until the final deadline.

He was unable to\ntell me exactly what those changes were, so I refused to integrate them.\nOffended, he asked me, “Don’t you trust me to make those changes?” Now, why did\nhe have to ask that?\nStop Whining\nYes, being the boss is hard. But no one cares.\n\n> One of my more narcissistic bosses practiced management by self-pity: “I never\nwould have started this company if I’d known how hard this is.” “Do you want to\ntrade places?” “I know your point of view, but you don’t know mine.” “I kept all\nmy promises and everyone else broke theirs.” Believe me, it gets old after a few\nmonths, not to mention several years. This person even expected her employees to\nfeel sorry for her whenever she terminated one of them.\nEveryone is guilty to of some rationalization and self-delusion, but people who\nactually want to boss others around tend to be guiltier than most. (Hint: if you\nspend a lot of time thinking about how you’re a good guy, you’re probably not)\nOne abrasive company president often complained to me how she’d be treated\ndifferently if she was a man. A departing employee confirmed that, remarking “if\nshe was a guy I would have punched her by now”.\n\nI enjoy working with managers who frankly discuss problems, but there’s a\ndifference between entertaining gripes and whining self-pity. If being in charge\nis really so unpleasant, quit and do something useful. If you feel\nunappreciated, tell it to your therapist. And if you’re really narcissistic —\nwell, you probably don’t realize this section is about you.\n\nPick Something\nReal leadership involves making the tough decisions. If you can’t make those\ndecisions, then, as I rather bluntly told a manager once — what do we need you\nfor? The first choices to make are in prioritizing, and everything has to be\nprioritized — features, bug fixes, delivery dates, customers, hiring, buying\nequipment, and so on.\n\n> At one company where I was maintaining a Unix application while porting it to\nWindows, the president of the company told me the number one priority was to get\nthe PC product out. When I asked him what about the Unix product, he thought a\nbit and said, “that’s the highest priority, too”. Thanks a lot, that’s really\nuseful!\nUnderstandably, managers like to keep their options open. Sometimes this\nmanifests as a refusal to make decisions early in the project, or a convenient\namnesia regarding past decisions later in the project (you know this is going to\nhappen when decisions are not written down). This strategy is as rewarding as\nsetting up your retirement account just before your retire.\n\nLead By Example\nNo matter how well-written the employee handbook or how well-produced the\ncorporate video, it is management behavior that sets the tone of the corporate\nculture. “Do as I say, not as I do” works great if you’re satisifed with a\nmediocre organization or if you rule by fear. But if you want a high-quality\ngroup and you’re not Stalin, you have to lead by example:\n\nBe Realistic\nThe biggest management disease is wishful thinking.\n\n> One Vader-like CEO intoned to me “This is the last time. You just have to take\nmy word for it”, when one of our helpful integration engineers insisted we had\nto deliver new features immediately after an official release. That assurance\nwas as convincing as “this is my last drink”. And it turned out to be just as\nvalid.\nDo the right thing now.\n\nBe Responsible\nIf there’s one common skill among managers, it’s self-promotion. And\nself-preservation (well, that’s two, but they come as a package).\n\n> When I worked on one defense simulation project that looked doomed, I noticed\nthe head of the department stayed a healthy distance away from the lab, for\nseveral months. But just a week before the deadline, when it looked like we were\nactually going to pull this project off, he showed up in the lab glowing with\nenthusiasm and optimism.\nIf you expect your people to put themselves on the line, you have to stick you\nneck out a little, too. One of my more annoying bosses liked to go around\ntelling people “I’m holding you responsible” but whined “Now everyone’s going to\nblame me” whenever she screwed up.\n\nEveryone makes mistakes. At least if you ‘fess up, you’ll have the respect of\nyour employees, and maybe, just maybe, they’ll take responsibility for their\nwork, too. It may not be the best corporate politics, and maybe you’ll have to\nadjust your self image, but it’s good leadership.\n\n> I worked for one director of engineering who readily admitted her mistakes\nalthough she could easily have blamed all problems on our dysfunctional software\ndevelopment group. When a rogue engineer pushed ahead with his own release (and\nhis own agenda, to curry favor with the client) independently of the rest of the\nproject, creating more work and more grief for everyone else, this director\nadmitted almost immediately that it was a bad decision on her part to let him do\nit.\nOn another project where it turned out there was an embarassing flaw in the demo\nrelease — the director of software could easily have blamed a number of parties,\nranging from employees to vendors, but he simply stated that it was a collective\nfailure, we had to focus on a solution and fix the process to avoid similar\nproblems in the future.\n\nIf you make it clear you’ve learned from experience, maybe everyone else will.\nThey’ll follow you with more confidence, instead of fatalism. And if you accept\nresponsibility for mistakes matter-of-factly, instead of in some torturous\nsequence of denial and blame, then maybe everyone else will do the same and get\non with the real work.\n\n> One of my bosses seemed to expect a Nobel Prize every time she admitted to a\nmistake. Months later, it would be the subject of lore — “Remember I took\nresponsibility for that? Remember?”\nI’ve seen some leadership advice saying you should never apologize. I don’t\nreally agree with that, but an insincere apology is worse than none at all.\n\nOne of my favorites pseudo-apologies: “It’s my fault for hiring that person.” A\nfeeble show of responsibility while directing the blame at someone else.\n\nBe Professional\nProfessionalism is underrated. Companies sometimes brag about how much fun they\nhave and how they’re one big happy family, but parties can only last so long,\nand how many families actually want to work together?\n\n> I had one boss who liked to admonish her employees to “please be professional”.\nWhich is one of the more annoying things one can say, like “don’t be an ass”. It\nwas also an ironic thing to say, since her management repertoire included\nwhining, yelling, foot-stomping, tossing items on employee’s desks and\nterminating conversations by abruptly turning around and leaving.\nYou shouldn’t have to like all your coworkers to have a decent job. (That would\nreally limit your options) As with politeness, professionalism can make bad\nsituations tolerable and make good situations last longer.\n\n> The aforementioned employer told me she didn’t care if departing employees had\nresentful feelings about their jobs, and then in the same conversation she\nwondered how to keep ex-employees from spreading a bad reputation for her\ncompany. Apparently, she didn’t see the link.\nTypically, even inept and slimy employers will be smooth when easing employees\nout the door. “Glad to have you, sorry it didn’t work out.”\n\nBe Fair\nDon’t be fooled by seeing all those warm bodies in the cubicles staying late in\nthe day — they’re not necessarily working (the Internet is a wonderful thing),\nand there’s sure to be a stampede for the exit once the boss’s car leaves the\nparking lot.\n\nBut employees might conscientiously put in the effort if they see that effort\nfrom you.\n\n> On one tightly-scheduled porting project, I was responsible for the bulk of the\ncode and consequently spent the first few months working eighty-hours weeks. I\ndidn’t get much assistance from outside the group, but I was greatly\nappreciative when the other members witnessed my long hours and offered to help\nin any way they could.\nIn particular, if you expect people to go above and beyond the call of duty and\ngive up their personal time, you’d better show you’re willing to make the same\nsacrifice.\n\n> I’ve been on more than one project where the manager, just before going to the\ngym, would tell everyone to stay late at work. One manager asked me to wait for\nher in the office after hours until her aerobics class finished — upon return\nshe ignored me another half hour until I finally asked what she wanted to talk\nabout. “I just wanted to tell you you’re doing a good job.” Wow, that was worth\nskipping dinner.\nThe message — my time is more important than yours.

When I interviewed\nwith three groups at one research institute, two of them gave me quiz questions.\nOne was such a simple question (how to traverse a linked list), I finished\nwriting the code before the interviewer finished turning around after saying\n“take as much time as you need.” The other question was something about garbage\ncollection which I thought the interviewer got wrong. So I opted to work in the\nthird group because they didn’t ask me any silly questions. Which is probably\nnot the most pragmatic approach to career decisions, but hey, principles. And at\nleast I didn’t just toss the quiz into the trash like another applicant did (he\nlater wrote a popular programming book).\n\nAt least those interviews still had an interview part. My first introduction to\nthe all-quiz format was a phone interview with Google. The guy said he was going\nto ask me some Java questions, I said I haven’t used Java in a couple of years\nbut OK, then he apparently thought that meant I’d forgotten all of Java so he\nwould try C. Whatever. After an uninteresting session of\nhow-would-you-implement-this over the phone, he asked if I had any questions for\nhim, and all I could think of was, what kind of stupid interview is this where\nyou show no interest in anything I’ve done, and should I take his invitation\nliterally and start quizzing him? But I just said no, and the lack of interest\nwas mutual. When I told a Google recruiter years later that I’m not going\nthrough that again, he assured me they vastly improved their process by cutting\ndown the number of quizzes.\n\nAs with Microsoft and puzzles, Google popularized the quiz-first interview, but\nthe game industry is hard-core about it. Members of one game studio cautioned me\nnot to get too upset at the upcoming questioning. My favorite question was\nnon-technical: “Why do you want to work here?” “I haven’t decided, yet.” The\nquizzer was actually a cool guy and apologized for the quiz a few years later\nafter going through a guantlet of them himself. I was baffled at another\ninterview because the quizzer was someone I worked with before. I was thinking,\ndon’t you remember working with me for a year?\n\nA lot of this quizzing business is just lazy bureacratic screening (after a\nphone quiz with Amazon, they got back to me and said a different position opened\nup, I just had to answer all the same questions I answered last time), but some\nof it is showing off. A virtual world startup (back when virtual worlds were\nhot) required me to take an online quiz, then a bonus question over the phone,\nand then a talk with the CTO, who quizzed me step by step over the construction\nof a hypothetical compiler, and at one point said let’s assume you answered this\npart incorrectly, so he could go through an explanation. After that, they said\nthey’d fly me up for an on-site interview, but changed their minds and wanted\none more phone interview with a team lead. I said OK, thought about adding “as\nlong as there or no more quiz questions”, but thought that was snarky and\nunnecessary. I was at least half wrong. The lead started off by asking me to\ncome up with a classic circle-drawing trick (I think you can find it on\nfolklore.org), I decided that was a quiz too far and I was getting hungry, so I\nterminated the interview.\n\nThe quizzing can also backfire if the interviewer is wrong. At one startup, I\nhad an overall nice interview because I insisted on meeting everyone and making\nsure I got a good vibe (after being at a stressfully political place), but one\nlead did ask me some quiz questions and he thought that grabbing a lock in Java\nprevented any other methods from being called on that object, whether or not\nthey also tried to grab the lock. I got the job, anyway, and he was a good\nprogrammer, just confused on that topic (just about every programmer I know is\nconfused about something – often it’s Unicode), but it does beg the question: if\nthe interviewer is asking an important question and doesn’t know the answer\nhimself, should he quit? Get a job in Customs?\n\nAnother time when the quiz answers don’t seem to be important is when I mention\nI was invited to apply by the founder. That’s happened a couple of times and in\nboth cases the quizzing stopped, and the interviewer said “Oh, never mind this,\nthen.” That’s almost worse than being quizzed. Then I think, “So it’s that kind\nof place.” And in each case, it was.\n\nI’m not saying don’t ask any questions, of course, but instead of handing out\nquizzes like a teaching assistant or expecting candidates to perform like\nmonkeys at a whiteboard, you should be asking good, useful questions that\nreflect well on you and your company like the ones you should be asking as part\nof your work. Questions that have a point and are based on research. Read the\nresume, look at the github repos everyone’s asking for these days. I got in a\ntiff on Quora with a recruiter who insisted that “Why should I hire you?” is a\nnecessary interview question. I assure you I have been on both sides of a lot of\ninterviews, and no one has been crass enough to ask that (or said, “Why should I\nwork here?”).\n\nIt’s not hard to weed out candidates with conversational questions, like “What\nclasses did you use in your Java project” (that was a softball thrown to a\njunior-level developer and drew a blank), “Why did you use XML instead of …?”\n(again, couldn’t answer…), and often, maybe I’ve watched too many police dramas,\nif you let them talk they’ll do themselves in. Like that candidate who kept\nevading my questions about his work and talking about how he liked Asian women.\nNow, that wouldn’t have come out in a quiz.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2021-03-01T21:42:22.000Z","updated_at":"2021-10-30T17:52:22.000Z","published_at":"2021-03-01T21:43:41.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null},{"id":"603e567bb60eaa0039e64061","uuid":"9c101c00-7e67-4f7c-9f6b-eb530e13ce34","title":"The Demon In The Freezer","slug":"the-demon-in-the-freezer","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Demon_in_the_Freezer\",\"rel\",\"nofollow\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"I suspect when Richard Preston started writing The \"],[0,[0],1,\"Demon in the Freezer\"],[0,[],0,\", he intended the book to be entirely about smallpox — it’s eradication and potential resurrection, either by accident, warfare or terrorism.

But one thing I\nfound disconcerting while participating in the career-advice site CareerDean\n(which has since pivoted to the AMA site WiseLike), besides youngsters\ncomplaining about stodgy forty-year-olds and asking what’s the one computer\nlanguage they should learn, is the number of people asking how to find a mentor.\n\nI really don’t remember ever wanting a mentor, or any of my colleagues seeking a\nmentor, or anyone offering to be a mentor. I already thought asking for training\nwas lame — this is a whole lame level beyond.\n\nFirst of all, it just smacks of ass-kissery and suck-uppedness. I did have one\ncoworker on his first day say “You can teach me,” which, on a crunch-time job,\nis the last thing I wanted to hear. And then he proceeded to screw up on a\nregular basis. In his defense, he was usually following the lead of the company\nowner.\n\nWhich brings me to my second point. Your mentor can suck. In which case, you’re\nbetter off without a mentor. In the best case, you’re tainted by association —\nwatch out for that guy, he’s the pet/proxy of that incompetent scheming asshole.\nIn the worst case, you turn into that incompetent scheming asshole.\n\nI did work at one place that assigned an advisor for each employee, similar to\nhaving an academic advisor, the idea being he would help you with your career\ngoals, independent of your immediate projects and managers. It was a nice idea,\nbut in practice I met with my advisor only twice — the first time when he\nintroduced himself and explained the point of the advisor program, and the\nsecond time when I was leaving and he said “I’d leave too, if I could.”\n\nNow, I’m not actually against mentoring. In fact, I’ve benefited from the\nsupport and confidences of many of my bosses and senior colleagues. But not from\nany mentoring program but, rather, informally and, I like to think, because I\nshowed usefulness and potential, instead of just clamoring for attention like a\npuppy. And, to stretch the dog analogy, it’s important to show some loyalty and\ntrustworthiness, instead of biting the hand that feeds you (which is a\nconsequence if you decide to trade mentors).\n\nAnd this leads to my last point — you’re limiting yourself by seeking just a\nsingle mentor. This isn’t a medieval guild where secret tricks of the trade are\npassed from master to apprentice (although if people believe this, it explains\nwhy I’m occasionally asked questions like “What’s the secret to C++\nprogramming?”).\n\nIn fact, if you consider lasting influences, authors of books like The Mythical\nMan Month and The Design of Everyday Things would qualify as my mentors, and\nI’ve never met them. And with the Internet, bits of advice are even more\nplentiful.

It’s noted that the big automakers\ndropped the ball on getting EV vehicles on the market, and there’s a mention of\nthe emergence of the hybrids, but there’s not much analysis of why the EV’s\ndidn’t take off. And while Eric Ryan and Harold Miller went on to to bigger\nthings (Mr. Miller moved up to run a regional EV competition and Mr. Ryan became\na science education consultant), it’s not clear what happened to the student\nparticipants after they went on to win the national event in Phoenix.\n\nBut knowing what they’ve accomplished, I’m not worried about what’s ahead of\nthem. Every once in a while, we need a reminder that kids are the future, and\nElectric Dreams shows what can be accomplished with a little idealism and the\nsupport of community, family, schools and industry.","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/04/9780786714858_p0_v3_s550x406.jpg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2021-03-09T17:57:33.000Z","updated_at":"2021-04-11T14:42:54.000Z","published_at":"2021-03-09T18:00:33.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null},{"id":"6048d14f49f1f70039d72561","uuid":"cb5a4f04-741d-4e4b-b186-17a7abc919be","title":"Leading Geeks","slug":"leading-geeks","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[[\"em\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"http://leadinggeeks.com/\",\"rel\",\"nofollow\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Soul_of_a_New_Machine\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[0],1,\"After I wrote this, I saw the book sitting on a client's shelf.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"From the title of Paul Glen’s \"],[0,[1],1,\"Leading Geeks\"],[0,[],0,\", I expected this book to be asinine and useless.

Designing reasonable user interfaces is not rocket science. It’s not even computer science. I know there are plenty of researchers dedicated to the study of effective user interfaces and their design, but bad user interfaces occur not due to lack of training in cognitive science — bad user interfaces happen because people don’t try.</p><p>If you pay me a visit at my condo complex, it might take you a while to find my name on the phone number list pasted by the entry intercom. It’s not listed alphabetically by name — instead, it’s sorted by the three-digit phone code. So if you knew my phone number already, you could look it up easily! One might suspect that the staff at our condo management company was just sticking to an unfriendly but logical system, but there are a few names, including mine, tacked on at the end of the list in seemingly random order. Those names happened to be the ones the management staff forgot to include the first time around.</p><p>Now, it’s not like the names are engraved in stone. The page was obviously printed with a word processor. It’s not that hard to move the text cursor when you’re typing, and it’s not hard (I hope) to alphabetize, especially when the list includes less than twenty numbers. This is just another case of someone not caring enough to do a good job or think about how to do a good job.</p><p>Designing a good user interface isn’t always easy, but anyone can identify a bad one. We deal with interfaces all the time, from web sites to ATM machines to microwave ovens, and we have an idea what interfaces we like and which ones we don’t. Even those of a contrary nature who delight in presenting puzzles, or those of an apathetic nature who just don’t care, still have strong opinions on the interfaces they have to deal with.</p><p>That said, not everyone is suited to design an interface for everyone else. For example, programmers who like command-line interfaces and don’t see the point of windowed desktops are probably not going to make very good GUI’s. But it’s a bad rap to attribute bad user interfaces as the work engineers who design products only engineers can use. Forget that left-brain/right-brain folderol. Code APIs, whether internal or external, are a form of user interface — good ones are a delight to use and bad ones are painful to use, causing errors, delay and aggravation. (If you don’t like Microsoft GUI’s, try looking at their APIs) And a “creative” graphic designer might design something that would look great in a Powerpoint presentation but completely mystify users.</p><p>The best interfaces appear in labors of love that the creators want to take home with them. The worst products are those implemented with just enough effort to satisfy checklists from the marketing department.</p><h2 id=\"be-consistent\">Be Consistent</h2><p>The most important rule in user interface design is consistency. Just as drivers rely on consistent conventions with the shape and content or road signs, the user can’t navigate the application effectively if it involves constant trial and error.</p><p>I see this problem in various Windows applications (and Windows itself), when many, but not all, operations on an item are available from a right-click menu, and some are only available from one of the menubar menus. This results in time wasted when the desired function is not immediately found, and an obviously less trustworthy user interface model.</p><p>A common inconsistency in computer and video games is the lack of consistency between options in the front end (at the beginning of the game) and those provided by the in-game menu. For example, if audio settings are available in-game, why should you have to exit to the front end menu to change video?</p><p>It’s better for the interface to be awkward in a consistent manner than to be inconsistently intuitive in some areas and different in others.</p><p>The Windows recycle bin is a great safety feature (although not an original idea, of course). To really delete a file you have to delete and then really delete by emptying the trash bin. On the other hand, as I discovered to my chagrin on one project, the same delete from a network-shared disk is only a one step process.</p><p>Microsoft is an easy target, but Apple isn’t guiltless, either.</p><p>I was one of the original adoring Mac fans, but the insistence (was it Steve Jobs?) on a one-button mouse was misguided. Since the resulting hack — double-clicking — was copied blindly by Microsoft along with everything else, I have spent hours explaining with torturous logic to my condo neighbors (they figured out I was a computer guy) why they’re supposed to double-click on desktop icons but single-click buttons and web links, and forget control-click, shift-click, option-click or (Mac) command-click. And watch out for those laptop touchpads that turn lingering thumbs into double-clicks or mouse drags!</p><p>Even the MacOSX desktop can’t make up it’s mind — double-click opens files in the Finder, on the Desktop and in chooser dialogs, but the Dock and the System Preferences respond to single-clicks. More than once I’ve accidently changed my screen resolution by double-clicking the Display applet (the first click opens it, the second chooses an annoyingly low resolution setting)</p><p>Inconsistencies in API design slow down programmers and are sometimes downright dangerous.</p><p>I recently helped a client resuscitate a legacy Windows 98 product and get it running on Windows XP. Tracking down some odd artifacts in the GUI, I was horrified to discover that all of the MFC classes took an attribute mask in the same parameter position except one, and the previous engineers on the product hadn’t noticed the exceptional case because the bits they passed as the wrong argument just miraculously happened to work — seven years ago.</p><h2 id=\"make-it-clear\">Make It Clear</h2><p>Clarity seems like an obvious goal in user interface design, yet how many programs allow you to sit down and just get started?</p><p>I thought after the whole hanging chad business that the new electronic voting systems would at least have simple user interfaces. And the ones I’ve encountered at my local polling location do have a very simple controller — a clickable track dial for moving the cursor aound the screen and selecting answers. However, the system allows you to position the cursor anywhere on the screen, including the question fields, so it’s not clear what you’re supposed to select, and if you do select a field that’s not selectable, well, nothing happens.</p><p>API’s also can suffer from tack-on-itis.</p><p>If you program with the Microsoft Win32 API, you have to remember to use the newer versions of some functions that are simply extended with an “Ex” suffix and additional arguments, e.g. CreateWindowEx instead of CreateWindow. Try using Win32 without constantly referring to the documentation. Just try it.</p><h2 id=\"make-it-easy\">Make It Easy</h2><p>The one and only time I tried to order from a certain MacDonald’s near Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, the cashier responded “We don’t have any right now.” After trying a couple of other items, she finally informed me that they weren’t serving lunch, yet. But as I ordered a McMuffin the minute hand advanced from 10:59 to 11 AM and the cashier duly informed me that breakfast was no longer being served.</p><p>User interfaces can be bureacratic, too. Some force you to jump through a specific sequence of hoops, and sometimes you have to start all over if you get one thing wrong. Voice mail is pretty much designed to do this. But often this results from implementors taking the least-effort approach and just tacking on functionality.</p><p>High-end 3D content creation systems tend to have feature-rich interfaces — I worked on one that just chained together sequences of generic popups because that was the easiest way to program it. To use a texture, bring up a file chooser to select the image file, a color chooser for each of several shading options, and popup numeric entry dialog for each numeric option. Contrast this with the Macintosh control panel (old or new) — everything in one dialog.</p><p>Put the related options together on one dialog, and don’t make the user leave until done. And think about whether you even really need a dialog.</p><p>In Windows Explorer, you have to right click on a drive icon and select the Properties dialog to see how much space is available. In the Macintosh Finder, it’s always displayed at the bottom of the window.</p><p>Jumping through hoops on a desktop application is annoying enough, but on web sites it’s excruciating.</p><p>I’ve found travel planning on the American Airlines reservation web site terribly annoying if I’m trying browse. Type in your travel start and return dates, hit Submit, and if you don’t find something you like, you have to start all over. If you don’t “Search by Fare”, the resulting list of flights doesn’t show the respective fare, and you have to choose a flight and proceed to the reservation to see how much it’ll cost.</p><p>The sites for other airlines (Jet Blue and Southwest, for example) allow you to conveniently browse forward and backward a day at time to compare flights. Morever, they immediately show results for surrounding days so there’s a good chance you’ll see all the options you want.</p><p>Obviously, it should be obvious what to do. If you have to explain it, there’s room for improvement.</p><h2 id=\"but-not-too-easy\">But Not Too Easy</h2><p>On the other hand, there are some functions that you don’t want to make too accessible.</p><p>I worked on one rather large and flakey application that had a “Reset” button prominently displayed on the user interface.

And the ones I’ve\nencountered at my local polling location do have a very simple controller — a\nclickable track dial for moving the cursor aound the screen and selecting\nanswers. However, the system allows you to position the cursor anywhere on the\nscreen, including the question fields, so it’s not clear what you’re supposed to\nselect, and if you do select a field that’s not selectable, well, nothing\nhappens.\n\nAPI’s also can suffer from tack-on-itis.\n\nIf you program with the Microsoft Win32 API, you have to remember to use the\nnewer versions of some functions that are simply extended with an “Ex” suffix\nand additional arguments, e.g. CreateWindowEx instead of CreateWindow. Try using\nWin32 without constantly referring to the documentation. Just try it.\n\nMake It Easy\nThe one and only time I tried to order from a certain MacDonald’s near Johns\nHopkins University in Baltimore, the cashier responded “We don’t have any right\nnow.” After trying a couple of other items, she finally informed me that they\nweren’t serving lunch, yet. But as I ordered a McMuffin the minute hand advanced\nfrom 10:59 to 11 AM and the cashier duly informed me that breakfast was no\nlonger being served.\n\nUser interfaces can be bureacratic, too. Some force you to jump through a\nspecific sequence of hoops, and sometimes you have to start all over if you get\none thing wrong. Voice mail is pretty much designed to do this. But often this\nresults from implementors taking the least-effort approach and just tacking on\nfunctionality.\n\nHigh-end 3D content creation systems tend to have feature-rich interfaces — I\nworked on one that just chained together sequences of generic popups because\nthat was the easiest way to program it. To use a texture, bring up a file\nchooser to select the image file, a color chooser for each of several shading\noptions, and popup numeric entry dialog for each numeric option. Contrast this\nwith the Macintosh control panel (old or new) — everything in one dialog.\n\nPut the related options together on one dialog, and don’t make the user leave\nuntil done. And think about whether you even really need a dialog.\n\nIn Windows Explorer, you have to right click on a drive icon and select the\nProperties dialog to see how much space is available. In the Macintosh Finder,\nit’s always displayed at the bottom of the window.\n\nJumping through hoops on a desktop application is annoying enough, but on web\nsites it’s excruciating.\n\nI’ve found travel planning on the American Airlines reservation web site\nterribly annoying if I’m trying browse. Type in your travel start and return\ndates, hit Submit, and if you don’t find something you like, you have to start\nall over. If you don’t “Search by Fare”, the resulting list of flights doesn’t\nshow the respective fare, and you have to choose a flight and proceed to the\nreservation to see how much it’ll cost.\n\nThe sites for other airlines (Jet Blue and Southwest, for example) allow you to\nconveniently browse forward and backward a day at time to compare flights.\nMorever, they immediately show results for surrounding days so there’s a good\nchance you’ll see all the options you want.\n\nObviously, it should be obvious what to do. If you have to explain it, there’s\nroom for improvement.\n\nBut Not Too Easy\nOn the other hand, there are some functions that you don’t want to make too\naccessible.\n\nI worked on one rather large and flakey application that had a “Reset” button\nprominently displayed on the user interface. Users would click on that button as\nif it was an accelerator pedal anytime the application seemed unresponsive, i.e.\nanytime the user became impatient. The reset function was useful, but should\nhave had either a confirmation step or been an option within a menu. As it was,\nI suspect the reset probably interrupted more operations than it recovered, and\nit surely made debugging more difficult.\n\nEmergency and safety features, like fire extinguishers or the emergency break in\nyour car, should be obvious in function but inconvenient enough to prevent\naccidental use. But in keeping users out of trouble, don’t be patronizing.\n\nI worked on a chart display that had all kinds of unnecessary “features” that\ntried to avoid displaying anything that was not deemed presentable. For example,\nif the user zoomed out enough (using a scale slider) so that smaller items on\nthe chart did not fully encolose their text labels, then those items simply\ndisappeared from the chart. This was a bad solution to a non-existent problem —\nit’s easy enough to zoom back in if the display is offending the user’s esthetic\nsensibilities, and magically omitting data risks confusing or, worse, misleading\nthe user.\n\nDon’t presume to tell users what they want to do or see. Just give them the\ntools to do it. The Customer Is Always Wrong\n\nWell, not really. But if customers really knew what they wanted, they could\nstart their own company.\n\nI worked on a computer graphics tool that featured a somewhat atypical menu\nsystem — rather than go to a menu bar or an ever-present vertical list of all\nthe menu options on the side of the screen (common among our high-end\ncompetitors), our users would shift-click inside our 3D modelling window to get\na popup with cascading menus. When we took a survey among potential customers,\nthey said they wanted a vertical side menu.\n\nOf course we implemented the side menu, but that was a lot slower for\nprofessional users who don’t want to drag the mouse across the screen every time\nthey need select a new operation or mode, so we had another mouse click warp the\nmouse the side menu — the type of design decision that only makes sense in the\ncontext of a previous bad decision. And then of course the heavily populated\nside menu didn’t fit on the screen when we ported the product from the high-end\nSilicon Graphics workstations to Windows NT machines. And guess what — anyone\nwho actually bought and used the product for serious work used the original\nmenus.\n\nIf it’s as easy as just asking customers or your salespeople, then hire them to\ndo your job. Relying on user surveys, focus groups, marketing checklists and the\nlike is a cop out. There’s no substitute for observation, analysis and\ninnovation. And you don’t need huge resources to get it done.\n\nI spent one project listenting to a user interface programmer complain that we\nneeded user testing. Meanwhile, he was oblivious or dismissive of every stumble,\ninconvenience and point of confusion encountered by the testers and project\nmanager when trying out the product.\n\nYou don’t need to make user testing a big formal deal. Just do it. Watch,\nlisten, learn. The Computer Is Always Right\n\nUser interface specialists often ridicule programmers for presenting a\nuser-interface that models what the program is really doing instead of a simpler\nuser model. But they are at best half-right. Hiding complexity is usually a good\nthing, but presenting a user model that does not match the the application’s\ninternal model is a recipe for trouble.\n\nWhen I was a user-interface programmer for a large video game project, the game\ndesigners came to me with all kinds of game features that they just assumed\ninvolved cosmetic tweaks to the HUD, since they just considered how those\nfeatures would look. More often than not, they involved fundamental changes to\nthe game engine.\n\nIf the application model is too difficult to use, or just plain wrong, then\nthat’s what needs to be fixed.\n\nIt’s Not Just a Pretty Face\nUser interfaces are getting better looking all the time, but looks aren’t\neverything.\n\nI once worked for a neat freak who went around the office at night arbitrarily\ntossing anything she found on desktops into drawers. One book went missing for\nmonths. Worse, she instructed her lackeys to wire up the computers so it was\nnice and tidy, and utterly inconvenient. The test staff had to move desks in\norder to switch test equipment, and I spent an afternoon testing video game\nmemory functions by repeatedly crouching and blindly reaching behind a box under\nthe desk, because gosh, it would have looked too ugly to have those slots facing\nforward!\n\nGood looks make a good first impression, but that’s all you’re getting if the\ninterface is painful to use and everything is hard to find.\n\nI worked for one manager who had a minor in visual arts and insisted on\ndesigning the user interface himself, mainly by drawing pictures. That’s not bad\nin itself, and the pictures looked nice, but he seemed to expect that to be the\nwhole process. There was no description of the user flow, not much thought to\nconsistency, user model, or grouping controls by function rather than\nappearance. And despite this being a Mac app, no reference (or reading) or the\nApple Human Interface Guidelines, which is the industry gold standard.\n\nArtistic skill is useful (I’m afraid I can’t design an icon to save my life),\nbut user interface design is about analysis, empathy, and diligent research. It\nmay not be rocket science, but it is engineering.\n\nIt’s Not Just the Application\nUser interface design is about user experience, and the application interface is\njust one part of that.\n\nApple gets it right. Buying my Macbook Pro at the Apple Store was like buying a\nluxury car. I spent some time gazing at it in the showroom (the Apple Store),\npurchased it in a few minutes from an Apple Store rep who immediately retrieved\nit from the back and handed it to me, carred it out in a nifty box with handle,\ncarefully unfolded the quality cloth that wrapped the laptop, and zipped through\nthe setup process. And now, passersby at Starbucks often comment how cool my\nlaptop looks.\n\nContrast this with my previous computer purchases. Every time I bought a\ncomputer from Fry’s, it turned out they gave me a previously-returned box (in\nthe case of a Powerbook, the registration had been partially filled out and the\nMacOS install was only halfway complete — as it consisted of a dozen floppy\ndisks, I guess the previous purchaser got tired of swapping floppies). Best Buy\naggressively pushed an extended care warranty on me, left me in line for fifteen\nminutes to complete the purchase, and somehow I got billed by Microsoft for\ntheir Internet service (I wasn’t the only one — I discovered years later that I\nmissed out on a class action lawsuit). At CompUSA I watched a sales associate\nhunt-and-peck an old terminal for fifteen minutes so he could print out the\npaperwork on an equally old dot-matrix printer. Not quite as bad as the buying\nexperiences for both my Toyotas (nice cars, slimy salesmen), but I don’t have to\nupgrade my car every couple of years.\n\nIt doesn’t matter how well you design your application if the user is turned off\nbefore even using the product. Whenever possible, I start all of my projects in\ndesigning the installer. And don’t forget support — all of that goodwill\nengendered by smooth installation and a nice interface can be cancelled out by\none lousy call center.\n\nIt’s Not Just For Computers\nWhile it’s easy to complain about the state of computer user interfaces, and\nit’s all warranted, at least there are plenty of people complaining about it. If\nonly that much attention was paid to everyday things.\n\nTake my bills (please). Like GUI’s, they keep getting glitzier, as my phone and\nutility providers proudly announce their “new look”. But I still have bills that\nare folded and creased just far enough that when I detach the tear-out stub to\ninclude with the check, they don’t fit in their envelopes without folding them\ndown a quarter inch. My utility bill doesn’t list the account number on the\nstub, so I’ll detach it, fill in the balance paid, start writing the check, and\nrealize I have to go back to the other half to find the account number.\n\nMy doctor’s bill is worse — it doesn’t even show the balance due on the stub.\nAnd while the main part of the bill shows the balance (of course), it only lists\naccount changes in the month the bill was issued — any other charges made since\nmy last visit to the doctor are included in the balance but will never, ever be\nlisted anywhere! My question, why bother listing any charges at all?","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2021-03-11T13:28:38.000Z","updated_at":"2021-03-11T13:34:17.000Z","published_at":"2021-03-11T13:32:55.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null},{"id":"604b816e49f1f70039d725a7","uuid":"e3762fed-7c4f-49b7-8452-853a4f20c5f0","title":"Cinefex 172","slug":"cinefex-172","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cinefex/id512379220\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"An update from one of the projects I work on, \"],[0,[0],1,\"Cinefex 172\"],[0,[],0,\" is out!

But in\nretrospect, it’s apparent I’ve never left too soon (unless you count the\nseverance pay that I missed). Even if you’re reasonably content with your\ncurrent job, you should be prepared if it becomes time to find a new one. Even\nif you have to settle for less just to pay the bills, you’ll be ready when\nopportunities present themselves.\n\nKnow What You Like\nRather than waiting until a new job opportunity shows up and then rationalizing\nthat it’s a good move, recognize early on the type of work that interests you.\n\nI made one of my worst career choices when moving to Silicon Valley. Moving to\nthe center of the dot-com boom near its peak was a good move — taking a job\noffer because it was convenient was the mistake. With a little more effort I\ncould have continued talks with AvantGo, a company that appeared to be filled\nwith talent and developed mobile applications, one of my top interests.\n\n Instead, I went to a software startup that had just been acquired by PRI\nAutomation, a supplier of semiconductor fab equipment company I knew and\nrespected the CTO whom I had worked for previously, and they offered me a job\nalmost immediately. After a wasted year of turmoil and corporate intrigue,\nduring which I found the whole field of manufacturing completely boring (and the\nstate of manufacturing software completely appalling), I found another job at a\nmobile internet startup called Neomar. That didn’t last long, either, but it was\na lot more fun, and we had a product out in six months.\n\nDon’t fall into the trap of just taking a job because it’s convenient, or\nbecause you’re dissatisfied with your current job and anything new sounds\nbetter.\n\nKnow What You Want\nI have an uncle, a Silicon Valley executive, who has tried to impress upon me\nthe importance of having a five-year career plan. I still prefer to wing it (and\nlook where it’s got me), but I do feel you should know the direction you want\nyour career to go.\n\nMy best career move was in leaving the defense contractor BBN for a small\ncompany developing commercial 3D software called Nichimen Graphics. BBN had a\ngreat technology history and culture, but I’d worked on corporate and government\nprojects for my entire career, and, especially with the Internet boom starting,\nI wanted to work on products that you didn’t need a security clearance to use.\nNichimen didn’t last long, but it turned out that I really did get more\nsatisfaction from delivering shrink-wrapped packages to real consumers, and\nsmall companies moved at a pace that I enjoyed.\n\nFigure the Odds\nMy advice — don’t take a new job unless it offers at least two distinct things\nthat appeal to you.\n\nI once asked a prospective employer what I would get out of the job. The only\nreason she could come up — “You’ll learn a lot.” And I did — mostly, that I\nshouldn’t have taken the job.\n\nIt’s a matter of risk management — if you change jobs based on one reason, it\nmay well turn out that rationale was invalid. But if you have more than one\nreason for taking the job (and being unhappy with your previous job doesn’t\ncount), then there’s a decent chance you won’t feel like you made a terrible\nmistake.\n\nPeer-to-Peer Networking\nRecruiters writing job-advice columns love to tell you how you should network by\ncalling up all everyone you know when you need a job. But that’s not networking,\nthat’s panhandling. It’s what recruiters do, but it’s pretty annoying.\n\nMost of my jobs and all of my contracts have come through referrals by friends\nand colleagues, and I try to keep them in mind whenever I hear of an opportunity\nany of them might be interested in. On the other hand, there are those who only\nseem to remember me when they want a contact name or even a personal\nintroduction (a lot of salespeople fall in this category). Those guys are on my\nanti-networking list.\n\nNetworking is an economy — you get out of it what you put in. If you contribute\nanswers and useful information to discussion lists, then you will more likely be\nrewarded with assistance when you need help (and more likely to be treated with\nleniency if you ask a dumb question). If you help people get jobs, then you will\nmore likely be remembered when those same people hire or make referrals. Those\nwho only reach out when they need a job, a loan, or introduction to business\ncontacts are as welcome as the pal who calls only when he needs help moving his\nsofa.\n\nMost importantly, be good at your work. People will remember, and the jobs will\ncome to you.\n\nDon’t Waste Time on Recruiters\nI’ve known people to get jobs through third-party recruiters, and I’ve managed\nto get some decent interviews and even a couple of jobs (but not good ones)\nthrough recruiters. So I’m not saying don’t use recruiters, but don’t let them\nwaste your time.\n\nThe last recruiter I wasted time on was an outfit called Remington\nInternational, a high-flying outfit located in a fancy Westwood, LA office\ntower. At least one of their staff was honest enough to tell me that if I didn’t\ncheck with them every two weeks they would forget about me. This was after\nwaiting in the lobby after being warned the previous day not to show up late,\nand then sitting through a “practice inteview” in which I was supposed to give\nthem leads at every company I’d ever worked at. But it was entertaining to watch\nthe recruiters running around giving each other high-fives.\n\nDon’t be misled into thinking that recruiters work for you.\n\nAt the height of the dot com boom, I applied for a position advertising a high\nsalary. But the recruiter from the imaginatively named firm General Employment\nnot only assumed I was at his beck and call (“Hey, I scheduled an interview in\nan hour — can you show up?”), he spent most of his efforts knocking down my\nasking salary. “It’s not 140k, that was a mistake. It’s 120. So you’ll take\n110?” Maybe his rent check was due.\n\nThird-party recruiters work for themselves — they get paid when they close a\ndeal, like realtors (but without the license or two-week course).\n\nBe Prepared\nDo Your Research\nIn this great Internet day and age, it’s easy to do some research on your\nprospective employer. Any self-respecting company, including startups, will have\na web site, where you can check out the company history, management and\nproducts. Not only will this allow you to form an initial impression of the\ncompany, this will give you a foundation for asking some questions during your\ninterview, either to impress your interviewers with your preparedness or to\nfigure out if these guys are for real.\n\nQuiz Show\nI don’t like interview quizzes (made fashionable years ago by Microsoft and more\nrecently by Google.\n\nBut quizzes are a fact of life and you should prepared for them. I prefer asking\ncandidates about their projects, why they made the choices they did, and what\ntools they used. Anyone who actually accomplished anything should be able to\nanswer those questions.\n\nDuring the height of the dot-com era, I interviewed a Java programmer who cited\ninvolvement in several Java web projects but could not name a single Java\nclasses she used in any of those projects. And yet she expected close to a\nsix-figure salary!\n\nIt’s easy to forget the various tools, languages and API’s that one encounters\nin a programming career, but take the time to review them and jog your memory\nbefore the interview.\n\nOne C++ game programmer I interviewed kept talking about “object orientated”\nprogramming. That was really distracting.\n\nDon’t Ask, Don’t Tell\nImportant as it is to refrain from discussing race, sex and religion in the\nworkplace, it is even more crucial to keep your opinions to yourself in the\ninterview. There are plenty of federal regulations intended to prevent those\nfactors from keeping you out of a job, so take advantage of that protection. If\nit means that much to you, you can inflict your opinions, pecadilloes and dogma\non your coworkers-to-be when they’re stuck with you.\n\nPut Your Best Face Forward\nThis is stating the obvious, but make a good impression.\n\nI interviewed a technical writer who was looking to make a move from Chicago to\nthe bay area during the dot com boom. On the cover of the technical report he\nsubmitted as as a writing sample, “technical” was misspelled.\n\nCross your t’s and dot your i’s.\n\nDon’t Look Like a Mercenary\nOf course, money is important (unless you’re fortunate enough to be young, rich\nand stupid). But when you’re applying for a job, you should at least pretend\nthat money is not your only motivation.\n\nA coworker introduced me over a cheap dinner to a friend of his who expressed\nsome interest in working for our company. His only real question to me was “how\nmuch does the job pay?”. Considering he didn’t have much to say about himself,\nand we weren’t a large company looking for a Level 2 Software Engineer with a\nspecific pay grade, I had no idea and little interest in coming up with a\nfigure. I couldn’t tell how good he was, but I was under the definite impression\nthat his primary interest was in finding a higher salary.\n\nDon’t Be Late\nFirst impressions make a difference, and showing up late to an interview is just\nabout the first possible bad impression you can make.\n\nI used to have a terrible punctuality problem, but the worst was when I showed\nup a half hour late for an interview with iRobot — I left work at what I thought\nwas the last possible momemnt and then crawled through commuter traffic all\nalong the Charles River. For some reason, I seem to be more punctual these days,\npossibly because I no longer deal with Boston traffic, but also I try to get\nthere a bit earlier, at least to scope out the lay of the land.\n\nScheduling yourself to arrive fifteen minutes to half an hour early gives you\nsome safety margin — and if you do get there early, it gives you time to check\nout the office building and check out the surrounding area.\n\nDon’t Be Weird\nIf you’re rich and weird, you’re eccentric. If you’re interviewing, keep a lid\non it.\n\nI conducted one of the most painful interviews of my life with a guy who started\noff by professing his infatuation with Asian women (“I love Asian women”, I\nbelieve were his exact words). I can only imagine he got started on that thread\nbecause the previous person who interviewed him was an Asian woman (and in\nmanagement, to boot). It turns out that was the most interesting thing he had to\nsay for the next very long hour.\n\nLook for Flaws\nA new job is an investment — you are committing time in the expectation of\ngaining income, expertise and connections that will advance you in terms of\ncareer, finance and overall happiness. There is an opportunity cost in taking a\nnew job — that is time you could spend elsewhere, learning other skills,\ncompleting other projects and meeting other people. So do your “due diligence”.\n\nThe First Date\nJob interviews are like first dates. Everyone is on their best behavior, so any\nvisible flaw you see will certainly be present several times over if you\nactually “hook up”.\n\nI spent one interview listening to the general manager yelling into the phone at\nhis subordinates.

And while employers are quite willing to point out that\neconomic times are slow, the job market is not good, and the cost of living in\ntheir area may be lower than others, they are not quite so enthusiastic about\noffering more when times are hot and they are based in an expensive area.\n\nThe one time I took a significant pay cut for a new job, I regretted it. The\ndecrease was even more significant if you consider the portion that was actually\na signing bonus and returnable if I left the company for any reason during the\nfirst year, and if you count the markedly lower benefits. The company shares\nmentioned in the offer letter were conveniently forgotten by the employer, and\nthe job turned out to be quite unpleasant. It didn’t take me long to feel stupid\n— right after I joined, my new boss rattled on about how she was willing to pay\ntwice as much for others she was trying to recruit.\n\nSo if you’re taking a pay cut, be sure about what you’re getting in return.\n\nAnd (this is old news now since the dot com bust) don’t do it just for the stock\noptions.\n\nWhen I left PRI, I didn’t bother to exercise the startup’s pre-IPO shares,\nreasoning that the money was better spent on a Dreamcast (and it was). When I\nleft Neomar, I did exercise my options, but largely out of politeness — the\nstock certificate still sits on my wall today.\n\nI will note, however, that employee stock purchase plans in a public company are\na good deal. If always sell as soon as possible, you’ll make a little something.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2021-03-14T06:06:07.000Z","updated_at":"2021-03-14T06:12:13.000Z","published_at":"2021-03-14T06:12:13.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null},{"id":"604dc4812093e1003b704151","uuid":"91cc930a-d3a7-4deb-a6f6-554e195b69f3","title":"Seinfeldia","slug":"untitled-17","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://seinfeld.fandom.com/wiki/Seinfeldia\",\"rel\",\"nofollow\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"I often complain how during my few months working in New York City, people there routinely assumed I worked in a Chinese restaurant (“I’m here to pick up my order”).\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"But, as I was reading \"],[0,[0],1,\"Seinfeldia\"],[0,[],0,\", a delicious (I use this word because I just said restaurant) dive into the history of Seinfeld, I remember seeing only two Asians in the show: one was the venerable James Hong, working at a Chinese restaurant with his trademark fake Chinese accent (I was shocked when I saw him in an old sci-fi movie talking in his normal American voice), and the other was a Chinese delivery boy who made a phone call to China.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"The book touches on the lack of diversity in the show just briefly but also notes that Seinfeld formed America’s view of New York and (I don’t know about this) performed a key role in revitalizing the city.

There are a few individuals who will self-inflict crunch\ntime but more often you have studio management mandating it after waffling and\ntaking wrong turns (I’ve even seen one studio head repeatedly promise an\nearlier-than-requested delivery date every time it looked like we might be on\nschedule, resulting in three successive crunch times instead of just the usual\none)\n\nAnd the same goes for credits — there is no incentive for publishers to decide\nthey must make sure all individual developers to be fairly credited and placed\nabove their own names. The owner of an independent studio is not going to place\nhis or her name in itty bitty print below the staff and make sure everyone who\nwasn’t “loyal” enough to stay through to the end is fully credited.\n\nIf these guidelines are really appealing to the people who matter, you’ll see\nstudios and publishers voluntarily sign up and proclaim their adherence, but I\nhaven’t seen such a list. More likely, you’ll see the big publishers and studios\ntread more carefully around crunch time practices (possibly resort to more\noffshore outsourcing, and by offshore, I include Canada) due to attention from\nthe press and class action lawyers, and perhaps eventually adopt standard credit\nguidelines when the industry is unionized. I expect this may happen as the\nbig-budget games get more Hollywood-ized and involve more actor, writer,\nmusician and production unions. And independent developers will be the last to\nreform.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2021-03-14T20:03:42.000Z","updated_at":"2021-03-14T20:07:39.000Z","published_at":"2021-03-14T20:05:11.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null},{"id":"604e74e32093e1003b70417d","uuid":"dd2250f2-81f4-433d-8318-025403539deb","title":"All I Got Was This Lousy Stock Certificate","slug":"all-i-got-was-this-lousy-stock-certificate","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Back in 1999, I joined a wireless internet startup in San Francisco called Neomar.

Every time you\nfind something annoying, consider what’s bugging you and how you would fix it.\nJust today, I’ve encountered a web site that brings up a register form instead\nof a login form in such a manner that I tried to log in with it (this is a great\ndesign for a web site that lots of people register on and never use), and a\nbathroom stall door that I can’t tell if it’s locked and should be pushed or\npulled to open (perhaps airplane bathrooms are the gold standard).\n\nAnd then there’s my bluetooth-enabled, Pandora-streaming, tire-monitoring,\nservice-alerting car which doesn’t know how to adjust its clock for daylight\nsavings time (there’s a whole class of design problems with DST). I must admit\nI’m impressed with the side-rear-view camera which is activated by the turn\nsignal and has the commendable property of actually making drivers use their\nturn signals.\n\nYou could do worse than design something for yourself. Then you know at least\none person will like it. And once you’ve connected with your inner selfishness,\nyou can move on to empathizing with users. Or just fake it.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"status:free","created_at":"2021-03-18T02:20:40.000Z","updated_at":"2021-03-18T02:22:07.000Z","published_at":"2021-03-18T02:22:07.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":"6270d8fd981c6c00315c2cee"},{"id":"6052ff3193591b003b41bd39","uuid":"8ff30055-c5ea-4b1c-8051-fe55fdfaef33","title":"Idea to iPhone","slug":"idea-to-iphone","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"http://ideatoiphone.com/\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"As a mobile app developer, I am frequently approached by people with a “great” app idea.

The whole thing stinks: the\nhobnobbing (and worse, if the Minsky allegation is true), the money, the\ncoverup…and the total lack of reflection on the constant drive for donations, no\nless money-grubbing than corporate profit-seeking but cloaked in the idealism of\nhigher education.\n\nAs a student, I didn’t like seeing freshmen recruited into fundraising\ncallathons (and as a part-time employee, I saw the Institute was not\nparticularly well-run as an organizaation), as a graduate I was annoyed that the\nfirst call I received from a classmate was a solicitation for a class donation,\nand as a recent class officer I was astonished there’s an annual alumni\nconference focused on fundraising. It looked to me like the entire alumni\nassociation is a machine for generating donations, and I felt a bit used.\n\nSure, it’s nice to connect with old (and getting old) classmates, but frankly, I\ndidn’t get around that much while in school, so there aren’t that many to keep\nin touch with, anyway.

Calling a person a\n“creative” does not just describe the occupation, like “actor”, “engineer” and\n“financial analyst”. It ascribes a character and talent to the person.\n\nWhat’s wrong with that? Well, first of all, it’s a broad brush. Members of the\nad industry are routinely called “creatives”, but how many of them really are?\n(and if you’re going down that road, might as well call political campaigners\n“creatives”). I’m not just picking on ad people. Realistically, any occupation\nis going to have plenty of people who just aren’t that good at their jobs, or at\nleast not good enough to be considered gifted at it.\n\nAnd frankly, it’s elitist. Calling someone a “creative” implies that anyone who\nisn’t one, isn’t. Creative, that is. It’s like calling someone an\n“intellectual”, as a noun instead of an adjective. Oh, right, we do that. But\nyou have to admit, it’s kind of snooty (tune in for Wil Wheaton’s Conversations\nwith Intellectuals…snore), especially when you use it on yourself. Like when\nLinkedIn profiles have “visionary” in the description — again, noun instead of\nadjective.\n\nBut for that reason, “creative” is probably here to stay. Calling yourself a\n“creative” is like wearing a cool jacket (the same jacket that Don Draper\nwears)— as long as it’s in style, you can get away with it, and there’s probably\nsome self-affirmation value in it (I’ve seen quite a few meetups for “creatives”\nto get together, and even “young creatives” — there’s a nice puppy, good puppy!)\n\nAlas, with all these adjectives turned nouns, I’ll have to update my LinkedIn\nprofile from “creative, intellectual visionary” to the more verbose “a creative,\nan intellectual, and a visionary”.

And I’ve seen control freaks\nmicromanage all aspects of their businesses (to the point of giving employees\npop quizzes and approving individual secretarial office supply purchases).\n\nWhich is fine — passive, unambitious people need jobs, too, and there’s plenty\nof room for small companies specializing in services and small projects. But\nmicromanagement doesn’t scale, talented employees don’t like to be treated like\nchildren, and a large company has to run like a machine, not a series of bar\nfights. So when these companies succumbed to grand ambitions of growth and\ninnovation, the result wasn’t pretty.\n\nChanging your personality is as likely as changing your shoe size. So pick a\ncompany that fits.\n\nKnow What You’ll Do\nThe glamorous stories about startups include tales of persistence, passion and\nnights spent on the office couch. But that isn’t always necessary if you just\nwant to be your own boss.\n\nFrom experience, I know I can maintain a comfortable lifestyle working on one or\ntwo contracts from referrals every year and take it easy between contracts. And\nI know other self-employed developers who play a lot of golf, spend a lot of\nquality time with their families, and don’t work weekends.\n\nBut that’s not going to scale into anything big or popular. Be realistic about\nhow much your ambitions will match your own follow-through.\n\nI know of one outfit that put a customer forum on their web site and didn’t\nmonitor it for weeks at a time. After seeing it filled with spam and customer\ncomplaints of neglect (“treated like a two-dollar whore” was one phrase), they\ntook it down and blamed teh technology. Another startup asked me to introduce\nthem to high-level game industry contacts to sell their product, but never got\naround to that little detail of creating the product.\n\nYou should also be aware of what you’re willing to do. And what you’re not\nwilling to do.\n\nKnow What You Want\nBesides knowing who you are, know what you’re really trying to achieve. There’s\nthe mission statement you put in your business plan to impress VC’s, and then\nthere is your real mission. Whether it be getting rich, getting famous, showing\nyour dad you really amounted to something, or getting even with all those people\nwho did you wrong at your last job, you should know, as they say in acting\nclasses, “what’s your motivation?”\n\nI was recruited by the president of a game development company who told me she\nwanted to make a “great” game. But she spent more time talking about famous and\nrich personalities in the industry than about notable game designers or learning\nabout game design. After lots of schmoozing and mediocre development with junior\ndesigners who had to clock in like Walmart employees, the result was, mediocre.\nAnd no one got rich and famous.\n\nIf you know what you can do and what you want to do, maybe your method will\nmatch your ambition.\n\nKnow What You Know\nIt’s also important for the company as a whole to stick with what you know. It’s\nhard enough to set up a company, find good people, and raise money. Having to\nlearn an unfamiliar domain and gain connections and credibility in that domain\nwill make success nearly impossible.\n\nThese days, a lot of people want to be Steve Jobs. I was brought into one\nsuccessful software company that was taken over by a group who had made their\nfortunes in sales and services, and in short order they managed to run it into\nthe ground. Status meetings consisted of “when can I sell this?” The delivery\nprocess amounted to “you’re giving me a build today.” A process perhaps fit for\na burger joint (“you want fries with that build?”), but not for software\ndevelopment.\n\nA significant successful project requires all kinds of people — and chances are,\nyou’re not all kinds of people. If you’re a technology guy and not a deal-maker,\nyou need to bring in or partner with people who can bring in the deals. If\nyou’re a company builder and investment getter and not a technology guy, you\nprobably shouldn’t be architecting a new software product. Figure out the\ncritical functions that should be your focus, and do no harm in the other areas.\n\nExperience\nLearn From It\nIt’s easy to Monday morning quarterback a failed startup. I’ve often heard the\nquery “What were they thinking?”, but sometimes this is not really a fair\nquestion. The reasoning may have seemed sound at the time — certainly if someone\nprovided funding, then the idea must not have been an obviously terrible one.\n\nThe first startup I joined had a pretty reasonable-sounding plan: sell a\nfull-featured 3D graphics content creation system to game developers, based\nlargely on technical suitability and underpricing the twenty-thousand dollar per\nunit competing products. Who would’ve known that Autodesk would soon enter the\nmarket with a vastly cheaper product and established presence in the game\nmarket? I didn’t.\n\nBeware the entrepreneur who only knows (or remembers) success and thinks he has\nthe Midas touch. success with a startup is largely the luck of the draw.\nFailure, on the other hand, is not a bad thing — you can learn from failure. But\nsome entrepreneurs are repeat offenders.\n\nI worked for one CTO who exhibited many admirable traits, including loyalty —\nbut to a fault. I was a beneficiary (and much appreciated it), but one of his\ngolden boys returned the favor by alienating the rest of the staff and prompting\nseveral senior engineers to leave. (I was promoted quickly in that job) The\nattrition problem was eventually “solved” by putting the programmer in charge of\nanother group, essentially transferring the problem and giving him a promotion\nto boot. After the startup was ignominiously absorbed into an acquiring company\nand quietly extinguished, the CTO chose to start another company with, guess\nwho?\n\nShow me someone who’s running a startup, and I’ll show you someone with an\noverabundance of self-confidence and/or someone who’s tired of working for other\npeople. Either way, recognition of past mistakes (unless they’re made by others)\nis often not part of the package. But if you’re going to go through the school\nof hard knocks, you might as well learn something.\n\nUse It\nEspecially in a startup, you need to take advantage of your staff’s existing\nexpertise. Surprisingly, small companies can be as clueless as large ones at\nrecognizing individual assets.\n\nDespite mentioning repeatedly that I’d worked on military visual simulation\nprojects, the computer graphics company I joined never bothered to consult me\nwhen they tried to get into that market. For a big corporation, that’s somewhat\nunderstandable (although such a corporation should have the resources to set up\nan employee database to check for in-house talent). For a startup in which\nbudgeting and time-to-market is crucial, there’s no excuse — just send email to\nyour staff. How hard is that?\n\nI spent interminably painful weekly meetings in another startup in which the CEO\nwould raptly listen to the CTO expound on topics he knew nothing about. I’m\ncertain better answers about machine vision and image processing, for example,\ncould have been obtained from the engineer who did his PhD in machine vision.\nGiven that I’d just left a wireless Internet company, it would have made sense\nto ask me about wireless devices and operating web servers. (They almost tried\nto invent their own secure communciation with web servers, not realizing there\nis a standard used for e-commerce).\n\nEven if you stick to your core competence, you’re going to run into unfamiliar\ncustomers and application domains. Before running blindly into them, query your\nstaff — “Does anyone know anything about this/them?”\n\nFocus\nBe Cheap\nThere used to be a saying that Silicon Valley high-tech startups would decline\nonce they moved into new glamorous digs. That saying referred to high-profile\ncompanies like Silicon Graphics, but I’ve seen this happen even in early-stage\nstartups.\n\nWhen I joined a San Francisco wireless internet startup that had just received\nits Series A financing, they had just moved out of one of the founders’ homes\nand into a moderate-sized office in the Financial District. In three months,\nthey took a long-term lease on half of the top floor (where I had an amazing\nview of the bay), started purchasing expensive office furniture, and hired three\nadministrative assistants, for a staff totalling no more than twenty. When the\nnext series of financing looked less inevitable, the COO had to clamp down on\nspending and we ended up with twenty dollar utility tables as desks, to\ncomplement our eight-hundred dollar chairs.\n\nThe next startup I joined was based in artsy Venice, CA. So of course the office\nupgrade involved a complete redesign by an architect involving curved walls and\nall attached desks and counters had to have matching custom curves. A Fung-Shui\nconsultant then walked around advising how to maximize the good fortune of the\nspace. To no avail, as there were layoffs within a month after the work was\nfinished.\n\nDon’t spend money that you don’t already have.\n\nBut Not Too Cheap\nOn the other hand, don’t pinch pennies at the expense of getting things done.\nStarting with people.\n\nI was offered a bit of sweat equity to take part in a startup but bailed out\nquickly when I learned everyone else also had a day job. Thus is turned into a\nfun activity in which participants could play the startup game and brainstorm\ncool business ideas, instead of an urgent mission. If the founders had paid a\nfull-time contractor they could have had a prototype running in a month instead\nof blowing at least that much over the course of a year with nothing to show at\nthe end.\n\nAnd there’s no point in investing in people if you’re not going to give them the\ntools to get the job done right, and on time.\n\nOne company president who was ready to hire more engineers to accelerate my\nproject but unwilling to buy more computers. While he wheedled our partners to\nloan us machines, I had to tussle with the documentation and training groups\nover the existing workstations.\n\nThe saying goes, time is money, but in a startup, money buys you time. Don’t\nwaste it.\n\nStart with One Thing\nI’ve never seen a startup that tried to begin with several products at once\nsucceed. You can be GE later, but start with one project.\n\nOne startup that I consulted for was so optimistic they rented manufacturing\nspace and purchased booth space at CES before they had connected a single wire\nor written a single line of code. They could have implemented a prototype within\na few months just using stock PC hardware, but instead got distracted by\ndifferent ideas, ranging from robots and educational software to digital content\ndistribution. In the end, they had nothing to show. Another startup that I\nhelped get running also had eyes too big for our stomach.

Finishing something is the\nhardest part. Being the idea guy is fun (consulting is great work if you can get\nit), but developing, debugging and polishing a product, and then deploying,\nsupporting and maintaining it, is painstaking work that requires tenacity and\ndiscipline.\n\nAt the computer graphics startup I helped form, I don’t know if we could have\nsold anything, but certainly we could have had a usable product if I’d bothered\nto implement file save/export capability.

You need to prove to yourself and to everyone else\nthat you can execute.\n\nLook Ahead\nGrowing Pains\nMy favorite time to join a startup is when they still have less then ten people\n— at that time, everyone is still focussed on just getting something going and\nseeing how it turns out. Once the company headcount reaches fifteen, diverging\nagendas involving turf issues, managerial rivalries, and career ambitions rear\ntheir ugly heads.\n\nMy first job at a startup was chaotic but fun until the headcount reached about\ntwenty — then it seemed everyone had a management title and turf to protect\n(including me).

Usually, there will be compromises due to constrained budgets or limited availability of the target hardware, particularly if you’re in a small company. I’ve seen several situations where the QA group was first in line for all new types of hardware, probably reasoning that QA is responsible for testing on all platforms (turf may have something to do with it, too). But assuming there’s logic behind it, that logic is misguided.</p><p>Soon after I joined the aforementioned graphics software company, the QA manager chastised me for not testing my code before I integrated it into the test build. Well, I did test it on my workstation, but it happened to fail only on hers because it was the latest and greatest model and she had the only one (This was at a time when it seemed like SGI was cranking out new models every couple of months, each with new subtle hardware and software incompatibilities) This meant I had to sit at her desk to try to diagnose the problem.</p><p>Every programmer knows it’s ridiculously more difficult to track down and fix code on a machine that’s not set up with a development environment.

So record all test results. Better yet, write down a test procedure. Even better yet, automate testing as much as possible. Not only does automated testing, in the same manner as automated build and backup procedures, give you confidence that you have a known and reproducible process, but it allows you to test conditions that are impossible to create manually.</p><p>Automated testing is especially important in simulating network usage. When I worked on a networked virtual military exercise, manual testing revealed a lot of interesting bugs (submarines flying above water, ships plowing through continents, planes flying backward), but problems with handling high network traffic didn’t become apparent until the exercise day when I turned the switch on and our whole system crashed.</p><p>Web-based systems in particular should always have automated test systems. A lot of web startups see their products work with a few users and just extrapolate.

And I was more horrified to see that test crash the server immediately.</p><h2 id=\"bug-reports-welcome\">Bug Reports Welcome</h2><p>Testing is everyone’s responsibility. Hopefully everyone involved in developing a software product will actually run that product. So take advantage of that manpower by making it easy for anyone to submit a bug report.</p><p>When I worked with Silicon Graphics as a vendor, back when they were top dog in the graphics world, I had a love-hate relationship with them. Mostly the latter. Their developer support program was great, unless you wanted to report a bug. They officially could not receive bug reports — those had to be submitted to their (paid) customer support program which only accepted problem reports over the phone, via a receptionist who would take down your phone number and workstation system ID, and attempt to jot down the description of your problem. Weeks later, a junior engineer would call you back so you could repeat the problem description. Then the engineer would be transferred to another group and another engineer would call you.</p><p>It’s one thing to solicit bug reports from everyone, it’s another thing to actually get them. Only the truly motivated will report bugs if the process is at all inconvenient.</p><p>I worked with one QA group that put together a sorely-needed online bug entry form. The bad news — it looked like a tax form. Field after field, all mandatory and without convenient default values. The result, hardly anyone outside QA would submit a bug report, and any that were submitted tended to have misleading wrong data. Keep the bug reporting process simple. It’s a bug report, not a TPS report.</p><h2 id=\"show-me-yours-and-i%E2%80%99ll-show-you-mine\">Show Me Yours, And I’ll Show You Mine</h2><p>By the same token, use your customers as testers. Companies often do this with beta and even alpha releases, but there’s no reason to stop there. Assuming you have a real customer base, the real testing will start when your product ships.</p><p>I wasted several months fretting over a mystery bug when developing a product for SGI workstations and ended up releasing the product with a convoluted workaround. After several months of complaining alternately to our compiler vendor and to SGI, and then tracking the behavior down to a particular ordering of the libraries passed to the linker at build time, our SGI support contact informed me that it was a known bug that had been on the books for a year.</p><p>In contrast, one of my favorite experiences in adopting Java has been the Sun Bug Parade, which has allowed me to check if a bug I’ve encountered has been encountered by others, and what the current status is. As a bonus, the Bug Parade allowed you to vote for the bugs that you consider most critical and displays the current vote for each entered bug.</p><h2 id=\"protect-the-database\">Protect the Database</h2><p>QA has their own product — the bug database. The bug database represents the state of the product and should drive all development decisions. Thus it should speak the truth.</p><p>A month before the release date of a 3D graphics program, the company president insisted that VRML support had to go into this release (“I just want it”, was his cogent argument). After we wasted a couple of days trying to cram it in, I pointed out that our bug database listed 300 bugs, most of them categorized as high priority. The president said “Oh, I didn’t know we had so many bugs” and changed his mind.</p><p>Just about every QA group I’ve dealt with would escalate originally low priority bugs to higher priority toward the end of a project as a not-so-subtle way to tell developers what to fix. That is a misuse of the bug database — if all the critical and high-priority issues are resolved, don’t relabel low-priority issues as critical. Just say it’s OK to fix low-priority bugs, now. If management has prohibited work on low-priority bugs, then fix that (at least the edict, better yet, fix management). And don’t downgrade a bug just because no one wants to deal with it.</p><p>The grandest act of wishful thinking I’ve seen applied to a database was invoked by a game publisher who ordered their QA staff to mark all remaining bugs in the database as fixed after we made what we hoped was our final submission. As if the bugs would really just disappear just because the product was going to ship. The tactic made even less sense considering the European version of the game still had to undergo localization, testing and submission.</p><p>Cooking the QA books is not as illegal as cooking financial books, but it should be.

Since I was more interested in getting quality bug reports (or at least peace and quiet) instead of whining or tantrms, I almost begged the QA manager for the services of one even-tempered entry-level hire. I think that paid off — he did a great job sitting through crash after crash and submitting dozens of detailed bug reports every day until the code got stable.</p><p>Remember, as a tester you’re paid to find and help track down bugs.

It’s something you\ndo as soon as you have something running. It’s not just management that is\nproned toward delaying testing — programmers are often just as bad.\n\nOn my first commercial software project, the software was so incomplete and\ncrash-prone that I was reluctant to give the first “alpha” build to our test\ngroup. Fortunately, the QA manager insisted, and the resulting bombardment of\nbug reports forced me to immediately focus on the problems that prevented the\ntesters from exercising the application in any meaningful way. Left to my own\ndevices, I would have worked on what seemed to be the harder and more important\ncore 3D issues, and probably delayed too long on seemingly mundane issues like\nthe user interface, load-save functionality, and compabilility with all the\nvarieties of consumer hardware we were planning to support.\n\nThe bug count on any project has to go up before it goes down. Get that spike\nearly and you can whittle it down gradually, instead of attempting to deal with\nit at the end.\n\nTest Often\nOnce you start testing, keep testing.\n\nOn my first console game project, our publisher didn’t have QA department look\nat our game until just before E3, the big game industry trade show where\nretailers get a look at the upcoming games. That bit of testing just provided\nforeshadowing of bug reports to come — after the show they didn’t look at the\ngame again until less than three months before the submission date. Within a\nweek we had several hundred bugs logged.\n\nTesting should be a continuous part of the development process, not a footnote.\n\nTest Everywhere\nTest on all the platforms that you plan to support. You can’t assume that a\nproduct running on a system will run on all minor variations of that system.\n\nAt a computer graphics software company developing applications for SGI\nworkstations, our chief sales guy proudly informed me he sold thirty seats of\nour product to a prominent video game developer.

Knights can leap over obstructions but have limited mobility on the edges of\nthe board (“knights on the rim are grim”).\n\nI’ve seen plenty of projects where people were placed in positions where they\nwere ineffective — middle management positions without enough authority,\ntechnical lead positions without enough expertise…\n\nThe Sacrifice\nI hesitate to bring up the chess sacrifice, but there’s a pretty obvious analogy\n— burnout! In chess, overeagerness to sacrifice leaves you undermanned and\nlosing. In crunch time projects, if the crunches arrive too early, not everyone\nis going to stick around ‘til the end, or even stay effective if they do. And in\nchess, every game starts with a fresh set of pieces. Not necessarily so in\nsoftware projects.\n\nLose Gracefully\nYou wouldn’t think that chess is a violent game, but I’ve seen a few players\nangrily swipe all the pieces off the board after losing. Management likes to\nsay, “Failure is not an option.” Which sounds great when you’re winning, but\nonce you’ve lost, you have to decide how you’re going to behave. Blame everyone\nin sight but yourself? Or give everyone credit for playing a good game, and move\non to the next one.\n\nIf the outlook is grim or uncertain, you need to emanate confidence and\ncompetence. If you’ve recognized the game is lost, acknowledge it gracefully and\nmove on to the next game.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"status:free","created_at":"2021-03-28T20:16:16.000Z","updated_at":"2021-03-28T20:19:14.000Z","published_at":"2021-03-28T20:19:14.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":"6270d8fd981c6c00315c2cee"},{"id":"6060eb1d1b9ffb003bbf7a98","uuid":"0352e9c9-3e9e-463b-bb12-93147d27301c","title":"What It's Like To Be A Dog","slug":"what-its-like-to-be-a-dog","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.thewritersblock.org/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://oneworld-publications.com/what-it-s-like-to-be-a-dog.html\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Because_of_Winn-Dixie\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Because_of_Winn-Dixie_(film)\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"I love dogs, but the sight of my neighbors standing outside in the early hours of the morning waiting for their pets to poop reminds me that I'm a cat person.

Remarkably, this happened again a year later at the same\ncompany with the same contractor — a new router was installed, once again\nwithout notifying anyone in advance, and worse yet, this was the morning of a\nbusiness day, and once again during crunch time development. Considering that\nthe employees were asked to put in extra hours in the evenings and weekends,\nthis was really unforgivable.\n\nWhen involved in packaging products, IT needs to know the application\nrequirements and how to manage configuration changes.\n\nAnother game company I worked at developed arcade games running on stock PC\nhardware. Our testers discovered a graphics glitch just as some new machines\nwere being packaged for delivery overseas, and upon investigation it turned out\nthat our hardware vendor had stopped offering our the graphics card used in our\nconfiguration, so our PC configuration people had started ordering a different\ncard without considering that our game might not run correctly with it.\n\nAnd in some cases, particularly web-based services, IT is on the front lines\nwith the customer and should be acquainted with customer needs and expectations\nas much as anyone else in the company.\n\nOne of my favorite projects was a wireless web browser and gateway for handheld\ndevices. But for a consumer service that was supposed to run 24/7, we ran it\nhaphazardly. After some heated discussions with my managers about adding\nfeatures in before the launch date, I discovered our IT manager had already\nlaunched the service at his own initiative, with little fanfare. And when we\nmoved our office upstares for more space and a nice view of the San Francisco\nBay, the gateway machines were moved in the late afternoon with no advance\nnotice to customers or even staff. Any Friday afternoon commuters who wanted to\nbrowse the web on their train ride was out of luck.\n\nIt’s not just small startup companies that get this wrong. I’m amazed in this\nera of Web 2.0 how badly prominent web sites are run.\n\nI was an avid review writer on Epinions until I lost several reviews-in-progress\non Sunday afternoons — that is when when they scheduled their site maintenance\nupdate. Even Google showed some amateurish site management — I delayed setting\nup my Adsense account for a week because the password-retrieval page was down.\nThe worst case I’ve seen of a site-that-should-know-better was the local\nTime-Warner cable broadband signup page. For at least a week the page stated it\nwas down while an update was in progress, and for a while after that, it\ndisplayed the startup Apache server test page. If there was a truly competitive\nbroadband market, imagine how much business they could have lost?\n\nKnow the Rules\nLike HR, IT is part of every employee’s tenure from day one. The rules don’t\njust involve proper IT ticketing procedures. These days, every employee, and\nthus every IT practictioner should know the legal requirements and corporate\npolicies governing privacy and proper use of the IT infrastructure.\n\nI worked for one delightful employer who went into muckraking mode whenever an\nemployee left or was terminated — she would scour the former employee’s hard\ndrive and announce to everyone she found porn and lascivious email. Eureka!\n\nEmployees should know what expectations of privacy they have, who owns the data\non the computer they’re using, and what activities, e.g. porn-surfing, are\nrestricted. (Although a friend of mine pointed out that some occupations are so\nthankless, Internet porn should be considered a job perk)\n\nManagement should also know, or be informed, if they’re clueless, what lines\nthey can’t cross.\n\nIn one of her more vindictive moods, the aforementioned employer floated the\nidea of breaking into a former employee’s Yahoo webmail account, apparently\nassuming that was fair game if that account was accessed from work. It’s not.\n\nAnd you can’t depend on the company legal department for expertise.\n\nWhile wrangling over a contract with a large video game company, I complained to\ntheir legal department that one of their clauses made no sense — it stated that\nany licensed components that I built into a deliverable would have to be\nsublicensed by me to them without restriction. This indicated ignorace of how\nsoftware is constructed (e.g. just building an installer typically incorporates\ninstaller code from the installer vendor) and how software licensing works (or\neven what the word “license” means). Ever read one of those interminable EULA’s?\n\nCommunicate the Policy\nDefining proper and improper employee behavior is always a tricky business, and\ncomputers in the workplace make it even more so.\n\nTerminating an employee is often a messy scene involving weeping, yelling,\nbegging or all of the above. But sometimes what happens afterwards the employee\nleaves the premises for the last time is worse. People descend on that person’s\ncomputer and discover porn, evidence of freelance work, and even sometimes root\nthrough email (one of my employers read an ex-coworker’s email to his\ngirlfriend)\n\nYou could argue that employees shouldn’t make any personal use of office\ncomputers and anything they leave is fair game for employers who have to protect\ntheir interests. You could argue that it is in poor taste and unethical for\nemployers to gratuitously root through all the leavings. Either way, make the\nrules clear — that’s what employee handbooks are for. You Can’t Take It With You\n\nThe IT relationship with an employee doesn’t end with his departure.\n\nOne of my employers laid off several employees in a Friday afternoon massacre,\nnotifying them at 5pm. One said he didn’t have time to clear out his office and\nwould have to return later to do that, including retrieving information from his\ncomputer. As this obviously was not a trust-filled working environment, the\nemployer worried that this newly-disgruntled newly-ex employee might do some\ndamage on the network. My suggestion: as a regular practice, as soon as an\nemployee is terminated, back up that computer, save a snapshot of the final\nstate on CD, DVD or whatever for easy access later, and take the computer out of\nservice.\n\nTaking snapshots of departing employees’ hard drives is also a good practice for\nless cynical reasons. If the engineering team has to call up the employee and\nsay “Hey, where is that documentation?” or “Did you forget to check in that last\nbug fix?” you’re not out of luck.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"status:free","created_at":"2021-03-29T00:31:27.000Z","updated_at":"2021-03-29T00:33:30.000Z","published_at":"2021-03-29T00:33:30.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":"6270d8fd981c6c00315c2cee"},{"id":"6061ff8e1b9ffb003bbf7b15","uuid":"509e6a59-4a91-4770-8d5a-efc4b737b45c","title":"Taking a Whirl Tour on the GameCube","slug":"taking-a-whirl-tour-on-the-gamecube","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"My first console game gig was so miserable that I removed my name from the in-game credits, quit, and thought about becoming an insurance estate agent, but on the bright side, I took some time out to do wome writing, including this postmortem.

The game, published by Crave Entertainment and Vivendi Universal, combines a story-based adventure with Tony Hawk style extreme sports play on scooters. Although Whirl Tour is a multi-platform title and the merging of genres poses intriguing game design questions, this article focuses solely on the GameCube development. We started work on the GameCube in July 2001, a few months after the Whirl Tour prototype was completed and running on a PC. Crave received milestone deliveries every two months — the first one involving a GameCube build took place in January 2002. We delivered a build to Nintendo of America (NOA) the following April for concept review, and Crave demoed the game at E3 in May. That summer, Crave forwarded our beta release as a presubmission build to NOA lot check, the group responsible for verifying compliance with Nintendo guidelines. The final submission was approved in September 2002 for the North American release.

Our team was already working with a PC reference implementation of the game using Visual C++, so while we waited for devkits (programmer version of GameCube hardware that contains twice the usual memory and loads data from the developer’s PC instead of disc), we incorporated code that called the emulated video, graphics, disc and controller API’s. In six weeks, we had a pseudo-GameCube version of our title running, albeit at 5fps.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"We applied some optimizations to get the game running up to a slightly less painful 10fps, but there was always a nagging suspicion that time spent optimizing with emulator wouldn’t result in anything useful on the real hardware.

Likewise, we reaped benefits from obtaining the test consoles and disc-writer as soon as they became available. They arrived shortly before our first schedule GameCube milestone, so we were able to make that delivery to Crave on a test disc instead of a bunch of development files for a devkit.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Besides getting all the tools as early as possible, we obtained redundant quantities of each. The extra units saved time and provided peace of mind. For example, we ran 24-hour-plus smoke tests concurrently on multiple test consoles — when one console occasionally reported a fatal error and the others didn’t, we concluded it was a hardware problem and didn’t lose sleep over it (while were were losing sleep over other things). And when we had to return devkits for repairs (video card damage) and upgrades (PAL support), we could send back one unit at a time without stalling development.

Our preliminary implementation of dynamic shadows, using shadow volumes, was guided by an SDSG white paper and refined based on ideas exchanged in the developer newsgroups.

GameCube Architecture\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Another reason we got the game running quickly on the GameCube is the friendliness of the architecture. The graphics hardware (Flipper) supports multiple dynamic lights, multitexturing, mipmapping, blending, and fog, so most of our basic renderer features were easy to implement (though optimization required some work — see What Went Wrong). The GameCube combines a unified memory architecture (UMA) with fast 1T-SRAM, allowing flexibility in managing textures and the video framebuffer.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"The hardware features a generous 16MB of auxiliary RAM (ARAM). We used half of the ARAM for sound effects — given more time, we would have used the remaining ARAM to increase the fidelity of our sound samples.

Memory Management\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Although fast, the GameCube main memory (MRAM) is limited in size (24MB) compared to the PS2 (32MB). We stayed within the memory limitation by agressively keeping on top of that issue. By running on the test consoles as soon as possible, we forced ourselves to reach the 24MB target early, within the first six months of the schedule. The UMA meant the video framebuffer occupied MRAM. Since PAL resolution is higher than NTSC, we sized the framebuffer for PAL in all builds to ensure we wouldn’t have memory problems later. We configured all of the devkits to use only 24MB, so the programmers would know immediately if any level didn’t fit. Testers went through all levels in each daily build and in their email report listed any levels that didn’t load.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Flipper supports S3 texture compression, so we compressed as many textures as possible. Any such textures that didn’t look good after compression were reworked. This considerably reduced memory usage (and as a side effect improved performance and load time) and didn’t seem to degrade the visual quality noticeably.

When it appeared that we could deliver our first GameCube milestone on disc, it made sense to synchronize the GameCube schedule with that of the PS2.

Instead of building the schedule bottom-up by summing up low-level tasks, a method which accumulates error over time, we built the schedule top-down, placing the most importance on critical deadlines like E3 and the target submission date, followed by our milestone commitments to the publishers, and then juggling tasks to accomodate those dates. Adhering to the big-picture deadlines proved even more important later in the project, when Papaya was gearing up for the next project — any delay in this title would have just propagated to the next.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"The schedule was tracked with Microsoft Project. Milestones were marked as such using the milestone task annotation in Project, and features required for each milestone were listed as subtasks, down to a granularity of no less than one week per task.

When a task was completed, we filled in the date for the finished task and let Project recalculate the dates for the remaining tasks.

We did improve code performance by about 50 percent between E3 and submission, but with more NPC’s, water effects, particle effects, dynamic shadows, and so on, we just kept pace with the additional assets.

The game, published by Crave Entertainment and Vivendi Universal, combines a story-based adventure with Tony Hawk style extreme sports play on scooters. Although Whirl Tour is a multi-platform title and the merging of genres poses intriguing game design questions, this article focuses solely on the GameCube development. We started work on the GameCube in July 2001, a few months after the Whirl Tour prototype was completed and running on a PC. Crave received milestone deliveries every two months — the first one involving a GameCube build took place in January 2002. We delivered a build to Nintendo of America (NOA) the following April for concept review, and Crave demoed the game at E3 in May. That summer, Crave forwarded our beta release as a presubmission build to NOA lot check, the group responsible for verifying compliance with Nintendo guidelines. The final submission was approved in September 2002 for the North American release. Over the next few months, under the aegis of Vivendi Universal, we undertook localization for the European release of Whirl Tour, which was submitted to Nintendo of Europe (NOE) and approved in January 2003.</p><h2 id=\"what-went-right\">What Went Right</h2><h3 id=\"1-development-tools\">1. Development Tools</h3><p>When we started GameCube development, five months before the console showed up on retail shelves, development hardware was scarce and software tools were still under development. But we minimized the impact of this problem by getting started with Nintendo’s software based emulator and obtaining the tools as early as possible and in sufficient quantities.</p><p>The GameCube emulator provides API-level emulation on a PC. Our team was already working with a PC reference implementation of the game using Visual C++, so while we waited for devkits (programmer version of GameCube hardware that contains twice the usual memory and loads data from the developer’s PC instead of disc), we incorporated code that called the emulated video, graphics, disc and controller API’s. In six weeks, we had a pseudo-GameCube version of our title running, albeit at 5fps.</p><p>We applied some optimizations to get the game running up to a slightly less painful 10fps, but there was always a nagging suspicion that time spent optimizing with emulator wouldn’t result in anything useful on the real hardware. It was a relief when the first devkit arrived, two months after we started work with the emulator, but it took three months to really get the game built with the compiler (SN Systems ProDG) and running on the hardware. We had to wait for a GameCube port of the physics middleware, and we needed to update our offline data preprocessor to convert the little-endian data produced on the PC into big-endian data readable by the GameCube CPU (a custom PowerPC called Gekko).</p><p>Although we had to wait for a port of the physics middleware, it was still important that we received the devkits as soon as we did. Aside from the endian issue, there were a number of subtle differences between the emulator and actual hardware that had to be resolved, including differences between the Visual C++ and ProDG compilers. Likewise, we reaped benefits from obtaining the test consoles and disc-writer as soon as they became available. They arrived shortly before our first schedule GameCube milestone, so we were able to make that delivery to Crave on a test disc instead of a bunch of development files for a devkit.</p><p>Besides getting all the tools as early as possible, we obtained redundant quantities of each. The extra units saved time and provided peace of mind. For example, we ran 24-hour-plus smoke tests concurrently on multiple test consoles — when one console occasionally reported a fatal error and the others didn’t, we concluded it was a hardware problem and didn’t lose sleep over it (while were were losing sleep over other things). And when we had to return devkits for repairs (video card damage) and upgrades (PAL support), we could send back one unit at a time without stalling development. We also ordered hundreds of blank test discs in anticipation of daily burns and crunch time. The last thing we wanted was to miss a deadline for lack of discs.</p><h3 id=\"2-developer-support\">2. Developer Support</h3><p>We were fortunate in receiving thorougly good support from all our licensors and vendors — Havok for our physics middleware, SN Systems for our compiler and IDE, and Nintendo Software Developer Support Group (SDSG) for just about everything else. SDSG resources got us started on a lot of code. Our preliminary implementation of dynamic shadows, using shadow volumes, was guided by an SDSG white paper and refined based on ideas exchanged in the developer newsgroups. The final shadow implementation used shadow maps and was initially based on one of the SDK demos. For a screen snapshot function, we reused the source from a utility posted on the SDSG web site.</p><p>Access to SDSG was helpful throughout the project but proved especially so during the submission period. Our US submissions were rejected twice by Nintendo lot check, and our publishers wanted fast turnaround for each resubmission. Email and phone queries to SDSG resulted in quick clarification of guideline items and evaluation of proposed solutions. This enabled us to get the first resubmission out in less than a week and the second resubmission out in one day. Combined with lot check turnaround of a few days for each submission, the total time from first submission to final approval was just under a month.</p><p>The delay in getting a port of the physics middleware could have been serious, but a few weeks after we got our devkits, Havok sent us a linkable library that allowed us to complete a build. When it became apparent that we needed endian-conversion for our collision surfaces, they quickly sent us a run-time solution, and eventually a preprocessor solution that we integrated into our offline data converter. The GameCube port was basically complete in five months and we received incremental updates throughout the rest of the project.</p><p>We opted for SN Systems ProDG over Metrowerks Codewarrior because we were already using ProDG for the PS2. This minimized compiler differences between the two platforms (we already had differences in code acceptance between Visual C++ and ProDG), but meant starting out with a beta compiler. The few bugs we encountered were addressed quickly by SN Systems support, and the official compiler release was ready a few months before the first GameCube milestone. After that, patches and upgrades were readily available on the SN Systems support site, and they had quick responses to questions sent via email or posted to the gamecube.snsystems newsgroup on the SDSG site.</p><h3 id=\"3-gamecube-architecture\">3. GameCube Architecture</h3><p>Another reason we got the game running quickly on the GameCube is the friendliness of the architecture. The graphics hardware (Flipper) supports multiple dynamic lights, multitexturing, mipmapping, blending, and fog, so most of our basic renderer features were easy to implement (though optimization required some work — see What Went Wrong). The GameCube combines a unified memory architecture (UMA) with fast 1T-SRAM, allowing flexibility in managing textures and the video framebuffer.</p><p>The hardware features a generous 16MB of auxiliary RAM (ARAM). We used half of the ARAM for sound effects — given more time, we would have used the remaining ARAM to increase the fidelity of our sound samples. For songtracks, we used the hardware streaming direct from disc. The disc is small and fast, so we never had a problem with load times. The disc capacity is lower than a standard DVD, but at 1.5GB, it was plenty for our 900MB of data.</p><h3 id=\"4-memory-management\">4. Memory Management</h3><p>Although fast, the GameCube main memory (MRAM) is limited in size (24MB) compared to the PS2 (32MB). We stayed within the memory limitation by agressively keeping on top of that issue. By running on the test consoles as soon as possible, we forced ourselves to reach the 24MB target early, within the first six months of the schedule. The UMA meant the video framebuffer occupied MRAM. Since PAL resolution is higher than NTSC, we sized the framebuffer for PAL in all builds to ensure we wouldn’t have memory problems later. We configured all of the devkits to use only 24MB, so the programmers would know immediately if any level didn’t fit. Testers went through all levels in each daily build and in their email report listed any levels that didn’t load.</p><p>Flipper supports S3 texture compression, so we compressed as many textures as possible. Any such textures that didn’t look good after compression were reworked. This considerably reduced memory usage (and as a side effect improved performance and load time) and didn’t seem to degrade the visual quality noticeably. After E3, new assets pushed us over the memory limit, so we turned mipmap generation off until we had more space and a more selective procedure for mipmapping.</p><h3 id=\"5-testing\">5. Testing</h3><p>We made a point of testing early and often. Starting about a month before the first GameCube milestone, we released daily builds on test discs for our QA group. The builds were created from the latest code and data checked into cvs. Our testers issued a daily test report noting new bugs, verifying fixes, and listing minimum single-player and multi-player frame rates for each level (the build included an on-screen fps display).</p><p>Crave provided us with a tester from their staff who worked on-site with us and tested our daily build. At first, we sent our Friday build every week to the rest of their QA group, but in the last two months before submission we Fedex’ed them our builds, daily. We also set up remote access to their bug database and used that as our sole bug reporting and resolution mechanism. Since changes to the database would show up on the client GUI instantly, we would be alerted to the new bugs as they arrived and could investigate and update the database entry immediately with comments or requests for closure.</p><p>The Crave QA group provided valuable console testing expertise, including experience with a recent GameCube title, and were familiar with the Nintendo developer guidelines. Soon after they started testing Whirl Tour, their GameCube bug database contained about 200 entries, many of them memory card and disc error handling issues that would have been flagged by lot check at submission. By the end of the project, we had around 700 bugs logged and resolved for Whirl Tour GameCube.</p><h3 id=\"6-schedule\">6. Schedule</h3><p>Originally, we estimated the GameCube development of Whirl Tour would trail the PS2 by one to three months, for reasons including the expected delay for hardware and middleware and less in-house familiarity with the newer GameCube platform versus the PS2. But that meant we would at least partially miss the critical holiday retail season. When it appeared that we could deliver our first GameCube milestone on disc, it made sense to synchronize the GameCube schedule with that of the PS2. This allowed us to target September for our North American submission, which would allow the game to arrive on the retail shelves in November. And it greatly simplified our overall project schedule, since we didn’t have to track different milestones on each platform.</p><p>The decision to sync the schedules was consistent with our approach of top-down milestone-driven scheduling. Instead of building the schedule bottom-up by summing up low-level tasks, a method which accumulates error over time, we built the schedule top-down, placing the most importance on critical deadlines like E3 and the target submission date, followed by our milestone commitments to the publishers, and then juggling tasks to accomodate those dates. Adhering to the big-picture deadlines proved even more important later in the project, when Papaya was gearing up for the next project — any delay in this title would have just propagated to the next.</p><p>The schedule was tracked with Microsoft Project. Milestones were marked as such using the milestone task annotation in Project, and features required for each milestone were listed as subtasks, down to a granularity of no less than one week per task. We marked only real dependencies between tasks, no artificial links to force a nice-looking sequence, and we let Project calculate the expected dates. When a task was completed, we filled in the date for the finished task and let Project recalculate the dates for the remaining tasks. Thus we used the schedule not so much as a micro-management and task-scheduling tool than as a schedule feasibility tracker and early warning system.</p><p>We had weekly team meetings that initially involved only the leads and proceeded in a go-around-the-table-and-report fashion. Eventually, the format changed to include all team members and followed an announced agenda. This resulted in more focused and shorter meetings, sometimes lasting only fifteen or twenty minutes and rarely lasting more than an hour. Minutes were distributed by email afterwards. The meeting time was also minimized by requiring each team member to send a company-wide status report every Friday on his area of the project.</p><h2 id=\"what-went-wrong\">What Went Wrong</h2><h3 id=\"1-performance\">1. Performance</h3><p>The biggest disappointment was our failure to achieve our original performance target of 60fps for all levels in single-player mode. We did achieve the desired 30fps for multiplayer mode in all levels, but for single-player mode we could only maintain a consistent 60fps in two-thirds of the levels. The remaining levels alternated between 30fps and 60fps, so we had to lock them to the lower frame rate to keep the visuals smooth.</p><p>We made a mistake in not achieving and maintaining the target frame rate early. We started with a consistent 30fps in our first GameCube milestone, and the code performance improved all the way through the project. We planned on achieving 30fps for the first milestone and reaching 60fps by E3. The fact that we only had a few levels running at 60fps by E3 should have been a wake-up call, but we succumbed to wishful thinking and hoped that further optimization techniques would get us to our goal. We did improve code performance by about 50 percent between E3 and submission, but with more NPC’s, water effects, particle effects, dynamic shadows, and so on, we just kept pace with the additional assets. In the end, we still left a third of the levels below target in single-player mode.</p><p>It became apparent, too late, that many of our optimization techniques did not improve the worst-case performance in our problematic levels. If we had recognized this earlier, we may have been able to restructure the levels to exhibit more balanced performance. There were some architecture-specific optimizations that we did not fully explore, but again, we ran out of time.</p><h3 id=\"2-submission-and-resubmission\">2. Submission (and Resubmission)</h3><p>The NOA submission was rejected twice before approval. That isn’t a particularly bad showing, but there was a lot of pressure to get each resubmission out quickly, and it wasn’t fun. We cut it close in terms of getting the release out in time for the holiday retail season, so it would have been more comfortable if we could have knocked it down to one or two submissions.</p><p>The most persistent problem areas that kept showing up on our lot check submission reports included memory card error handling and on-screen depictions of controller buttons. We could have gotten a pass on the button graphics, but we updated the button graphics several times anyway in hopes of making them more acceptable to lot check. The memory card issues for the most part were not negotiable — there are comprehensive guidelines involving error-handling flow and messages. These are not very exciting features to implement, but they are required, and we should have tried to get that stuff done earlier.</p><p>Our programmers and testers were not familiar with the GameCube submission issues, and as a result, we were overly reliant on Crave’s QA team to identify the problems. Once Crave started testing the game, we basically had two months to rewrite our memory card, disc error, and reset-handling code, while simultaneously adding our shadow code, performance optimizations, and trying to fix all other bugs before submission. This was complicated by a couple of attempts in the last few weeks to advance the submission, which, in retrospect, now seems unrealistic.</p><p>We should have educated ourselves on the submission issues much earlier by reading up on the guidelines and examining other games, and we should have scheduled completion of all the guideline requirements by our beta release early summer. Crave sent the beta to lot check, but we didn’t receive the results until two weeks before the final submission. The presubmission report from lot check was useful, but would have been more so if we had tracked it down earlier, and if didn’t have so many violations (too many to fix in one pass).</p><p>We complicated the memory card situation by attempting to share much of the framework with the PS2. We delayed much of the GameCube-specific implementation until the PS2 code was nearly done, so most of the work was completed in the last three months before submission. The code sharing seemed convenient initially, but there were significant differences between memory card guidelines for the two platforms. The resulting error-checking and error-handling flow was somewhat atypical for a GameCube title, requiring clarification among the QA groups, lot check, and programmers. After hasty code mangling during the resubmissions to accomodate QA and lot check objections, the shared code was a mess. It seems obvious now that we should have completely separated the memory card code for the two platforms.</p><h3 id=\"3-manual-builds\">3. Manual Builds</h3><p>Although we had a daily build, it was not automated. We performed the build on a developer station using the ProDG/Visual Studio envronment. This allowed us to make quick fixes before releasing the build to QA, but it was not the type of clean and reproducible build that good configuration management practices mandate. An overnight batch build would have saved time (each build took anywhere from 30 minutes to three hours, depending on fixit attempts), been reproducible, and, if we set it up properly, automatically logged and emailed build results.</p><p>Moreover, an automatic build could have helped to establish a sense of regularity and process. The team members were never sure when the next build would be available, so eventually we had to send email every day announcing the build. Aside from the testers, most of our team members were still overly reliant on the PC version on the game and there was a slightly disruptive tendency to go straight to the programmers instead of checking the latest official build. And the fact that the build took place manually and not at any designated regular time made it too tempting to request new builds at increasing and irregular intervals, particularly during crunch times.</p><p>We had our data converter running every night by the end of the project, allowing us to check the latest art and sound effects changes. But the data build did not include processing of songtrack and FVM data, which were provided by external sources as WAV and AVI files requiring lengthy (hours to do a whole set) conversion to GameCube-specific compressed streaming formats. The FMV conversion was particularly involved, as we required versions for NTSC and PAL, and we had to extract the audio, resample and merge it back in to the converted FMV files. Unfortunately, the songtrack and FMV sources arrived fairly late in our schedule, so we were processing iterations of this data well past our attempted one-month data freeze before submission.</p><h3 id=\"4-wanted-tool-programmer\">4. Wanted: Tool Programmer</h3><p>We could have used a tool programmer. Our data converter was augmented by several different programmers in an ad-hoc manner, so new features were not consistently implemented with all the target platforms in mind. For example, although mipmapping and texture compression were technically multi-platform features, the code ended up in an “ngc-utils” file, and triangle-strip generation and texture palettization ended up in PS2-only code. A dedicated tool programmer could have developed the converter with more of a big-picture approach and taken some of the load off the other programmers, particularly the console programmers and lead programmer. A dedicated tool programmer could also have addressed the artists requests for previewing tools, which we just didn’t have time to work on.</p><h3 id=\"5-lengthy-localization\">5. Lengthy Localization</h3><p>The localization process for the European release took a lot longer than expected. Crave’s QA group was regularly testing our PAL builds well before the NOA submission, so we expected to have a submission to NOE ready as soon as we had the text translations. The game engine modifications turned out to involve new texture fonts for the extended character set, additional character selections for text entry screens, resized GUI elements so longer European words would fit, and proper synchronization of the in-game language with the console ROM language setting. The code changes took a while, but a greater delay was incurred by an initial one-month wait for the first set of translations from Vivendi, then several iterations with Vivendi’s QA group to fix translations, typos, and text trailing off screen. We made our submission to NOE three months after the NOA submission, and then it took an additional three weeks for NOE to reject the first submission and approve the second.</p><h3 id=\"6-a-mild-case-of-featuritis\">6. A Mild Case of Featuritis?</h3><p>We didn’t completely meet our performance targets, and we had a crunch time involving a flurry of fixes and resubmissions. So any work that didn’t result in obviously necessary functionality warrants reevaluation:</p><h4 id=\"audio-effects\">Audio Effects</h4><p>We had audio reverb and delay effects on our requirements checklist, but they were used in only one area in the game. It was gratifying to say we used the audio effects hardware on the GameCube, but it made our audio code layer significantly more complex and took several weeks to get it right. Compounding this, we were worried about the audio DSP dropping voices when oversubscribed, so after E3 we rewrote the system to handle this eventuality. But the rewrite took two to three weeks, the resulting code was messier, and once we had all the sounds in the game, the built-in GameCube metering hardware indicated that we were only using twenty five percent of the DSP cycles in the worst case.</p><h4 id=\"screen-capture\">Screen Capture</h4><p>We had a publisher requested for a screen snapshot function, which we implemented shortly after the first GameCube milestone. It worked only on a devkit and was used by our testers for their bug reports. But it’s unlikely that it was used by anyone else, internally or externally. Submission releases were not supposed to include debug code, so we ended up removing the screen snapshot code before the presubmission. All in all, we spent five months maintaining that feature.</p><h4 id=\"video-modes\">Video Modes</h4><p>Nintendo recommended but did not require support for progressive scan. We implemented it, but neither we nor our publisher’s QA group had progressive scan monitors, so we relied on informal testing off-site using personal equipment. Our progressive scan support was noted by some reviewers, but there was a cost in coding, testing, and added risk to the submission, as Nintendo has guidelines on proper implementation of progressive scan.</p><p>Similarly, Nintendo recommended but did not require support for 60Hz mode in PAL releases. The number of users who can take advantage of this feature is probably higher than with progressive scan, and this feature was testable in-house and by the publisher’s QA group, so it is a more justifiable feature But again, there was a development and QA cost, code complexity to handle both 50Hz and 60Hz modes, e.g. in selecting the appropriate FMV to play, and additional localization required for text displayed when switching modes.</p><h4 id=\"shadows\">Shadows</h4><p>We implemented detailed dynamic shadows for player characters and enemy bosses. If we had limited the detailed shadows to just the player characters and used blob shadows for the bosses, at least two more of the levels would have run at 60fps instead of 30fps. It wouldn’t have looked as good, but would have been no worse than many high-profile games that have recently appeared. We used higher-resolution shadow maps for the player characters, while allowing the boss shadows to have a more jagged appearance. The hi-res maps looked good, but the effect was subtle, and there may have been a performance penalty. Late in the project, we combined the shadow map blending with a location-based shadow value so the dynamic shadows would blend with pre-shadowed areas. Yet again, this looked good, but the effect was subtler still, and it was risky to make such a change right around submission.</p><h3 id=\"7-it\">7. IT</h3><p>Our server crashed right around E3, and although we had an automatic tape backup running every night, it turned out the data was unrecoverable. Fortunately, we had local copies of the working data distributed around the office, and we had performed periodic manual backups on DVD. It took a while to piece together all our code and assets, and some of the work done just before E3 was lost. It could have been worse, but we did pay a the price for failing to ensure the integrity of our backup system.</p><p>After the server crash, we spent the next several months upgrading our IT infrastructure. This didn’t distract too much from the ongoing development work, but we could have done a better job of minimizing disruptions by communicating and coordinating the IT plans. For example, switching from local accounts to domain-based accounts made some development tools unusable until some Windows registry values were updated. Even then, we were unable to upgrade our ProDG installation, which meant we were unable to upgrade the Nintendo SDK. And we had to use the original local account for our disk burns. We could have attempted to diagnose the problems or at worst perform a complete reinstallation, but with crunch time starting and the submission deadline looming, we really didn’t want to take the time. This might have been avoided if we had discussed the IT planning in our weekly meetings and coordinated some upgrade tests and fallback policies.</p><h2 id=\"lessons-learned\">Lessons Learned</h2><p>This article focused on the GameCube development of Whirl Tour, but most of these issues are applicable to console development in general.

The game, published by Crave Entertainment and Vivendi\nUniversal, combines a story-based adventure with Tony Hawk style extreme sports\nplay on scooters. Although Whirl Tour is a multi-platform title and the merging\nof genres poses intriguing game design questions, this article focuses solely on\nthe GameCube development. We started work on the GameCube in July 2001, a few\nmonths after the Whirl Tour prototype was completed and running on a PC. Crave\nreceived milestone deliveries every two months — the first one involving a\nGameCube build took place in January 2002. We delivered a build to Nintendo of\nAmerica (NOA) the following April for concept review, and Crave demoed the game\nat E3 in May. That summer, Crave forwarded our beta release as a presubmission\nbuild to NOA lot check, the group responsible for verifying compliance with\nNintendo guidelines. The final submission was approved in September 2002 for the\nNorth American release. Over the next few months, under the aegis of Vivendi\nUniversal, we undertook localization for the European release of Whirl Tour,\nwhich was submitted to Nintendo of Europe (NOE) and approved in January 2003.\n\nWhat Went Right\n1. Development Tools\nWhen we started GameCube development, five months before the console showed up\non retail shelves, development hardware was scarce and software tools were still\nunder development. But we minimized the impact of this problem by getting\nstarted with Nintendo’s software based emulator and obtaining the tools as early\nas possible and in sufficient quantities.\n\nThe GameCube emulator provides API-level emulation on a PC. Our team was already\nworking with a PC reference implementation of the game using Visual C++, so\nwhile we waited for devkits (programmer version of GameCube hardware that\ncontains twice the usual memory and loads data from the developer’s PC instead\nof disc), we incorporated code that called the emulated video, graphics, disc\nand controller API’s. In six weeks, we had a pseudo-GameCube version of our\ntitle running, albeit at 5fps.\n\nWe applied some optimizations to get the game running up to a slightly less\npainful 10fps, but there was always a nagging suspicion that time spent\noptimizing with emulator wouldn’t result in anything useful on the real\nhardware. It was a relief when the first devkit arrived, two months after we\nstarted work with the emulator, but it took three months to really get the game\nbuilt with the compiler (SN Systems ProDG) and running on the hardware. We had\nto wait for a GameCube port of the physics middleware, and we needed to update\nour offline data preprocessor to convert the little-endian data produced on the\nPC into big-endian data readable by the GameCube CPU (a custom PowerPC called\nGekko).\n\nAlthough we had to wait for a port of the physics middleware, it was still\nimportant that we received the devkits as soon as we did. Aside from the endian\nissue, there were a number of subtle differences between the emulator and actual\nhardware that had to be resolved, including differences between the Visual C++\nand ProDG compilers. Likewise, we reaped benefits from obtaining the test\nconsoles and disc-writer as soon as they became available. They arrived shortly\nbefore our first schedule GameCube milestone, so we were able to make that\ndelivery to Crave on a test disc instead of a bunch of development files for a\ndevkit.\n\nBesides getting all the tools as early as possible, we obtained redundant\nquantities of each. The extra units saved time and provided peace of mind. For\nexample, we ran 24-hour-plus smoke tests concurrently on multiple test consoles\n— when one console occasionally reported a fatal error and the others didn’t, we\nconcluded it was a hardware problem and didn’t lose sleep over it (while were\nwere losing sleep over other things). And when we had to return devkits for\nrepairs (video card damage) and upgrades (PAL support), we could send back one\nunit at a time without stalling development. We also ordered hundreds of blank\ntest discs in anticipation of daily burns and crunch time. The last thing we\nwanted was to miss a deadline for lack of discs.\n\n2. Developer Support\nWe were fortunate in receiving thorougly good support from all our licensors and\nvendors — Havok for our physics middleware, SN Systems for our compiler and IDE,\nand Nintendo Software Developer Support Group (SDSG) for just about everything\nelse. SDSG resources got us started on a lot of code. Our preliminary\nimplementation of dynamic shadows, using shadow volumes, was guided by an SDSG\nwhite paper and refined based on ideas exchanged in the developer newsgroups.\nThe final shadow implementation used shadow maps and was initially based on one\nof the SDK demos. For a screen snapshot function, we reused the source from a\nutility posted on the SDSG web site.\n\nAccess to SDSG was helpful throughout the project but proved especially so\nduring the submission period. Our US submissions were rejected twice by Nintendo\nlot check, and our publishers wanted fast turnaround for each resubmission.\nEmail and phone queries to SDSG resulted in quick clarification of guideline\nitems and evaluation of proposed solutions. This enabled us to get the first\nresubmission out in less than a week and the second resubmission out in one day.\nCombined with lot check turnaround of a few days for each submission, the total\ntime from first submission to final approval was just under a month.\n\nThe delay in getting a port of the physics middleware could have been serious,\nbut a few weeks after we got our devkits, Havok sent us a linkable library that\nallowed us to complete a build. When it became apparent that we needed\nendian-conversion for our collision surfaces, they quickly sent us a run-time\nsolution, and eventually a preprocessor solution that we integrated into our\noffline data converter. The GameCube port was basically complete in five months\nand we received incremental updates throughout the rest of the project.\n\nWe opted for SN Systems ProDG over Metrowerks Codewarrior because we were\nalready using ProDG for the PS2. This minimized compiler differences between the\ntwo platforms (we already had differences in code acceptance between Visual C++\nand ProDG), but meant starting out with a beta compiler. The few bugs we\nencountered were addressed quickly by SN Systems support, and the official\ncompiler release was ready a few months before the first GameCube milestone.\nAfter that, patches and upgrades were readily available on the SN Systems\nsupport site, and they had quick responses to questions sent via email or posted\nto the gamecube.snsystems newsgroup on the SDSG site.\n\n3. GameCube Architecture\nAnother reason we got the game running quickly on the GameCube is the\nfriendliness of the architecture. The graphics hardware (Flipper) supports\nmultiple dynamic lights, multitexturing, mipmapping, blending, and fog, so most\nof our basic renderer features were easy to implement (though optimization\nrequired some work — see What Went Wrong). The GameCube combines a unified\nmemory architecture (UMA) with fast 1T-SRAM, allowing flexibility in managing\ntextures and the video framebuffer.\n\nThe hardware features a generous 16MB of auxiliary RAM (ARAM). We used half of\nthe ARAM for sound effects — given more time, we would have used the remaining\nARAM to increase the fidelity of our sound samples. For songtracks, we used the\nhardware streaming direct from disc. The disc is small and fast, so we never had\na problem with load times. The disc capacity is lower than a standard DVD, but\nat 1.5GB, it was plenty for our 900MB of data.\n\n4. Memory Management\nAlthough fast, the GameCube main memory (MRAM) is limited in size (24MB)\ncompared to the PS2 (32MB). We stayed within the memory limitation by\nagressively keeping on top of that issue. By running on the test consoles as\nsoon as possible, we forced ourselves to reach the 24MB target early, within the\nfirst six months of the schedule. The UMA meant the video framebuffer occupied\nMRAM. Since PAL resolution is higher than NTSC, we sized the framebuffer for PAL\nin all builds to ensure we wouldn’t have memory problems later. We configured\nall of the devkits to use only 24MB, so the programmers would know immediately\nif any level didn’t fit. Testers went through all levels in each daily build and\nin their email report listed any levels that didn’t load.\n\nFlipper supports S3 texture compression, so we compressed as many textures as\npossible. Any such textures that didn’t look good after compression were\nreworked. This considerably reduced memory usage (and as a side effect improved\nperformance and load time) and didn’t seem to degrade the visual quality\nnoticeably. After E3, new assets pushed us over the memory limit, so we turned\nmipmap generation off until we had more space and a more selective procedure for\nmipmapping.\n\n5. Testing\nWe made a point of testing early and often. Starting about a month before the\nfirst GameCube milestone, we released daily builds on test discs for our QA\ngroup. The builds were created from the latest code and data checked into cvs.\nOur testers issued a daily test report noting new bugs, verifying fixes, and\nlisting minimum single-player and multi-player frame rates for each level (the\nbuild included an on-screen fps display).\n\nCrave provided us with a tester from their staff who worked on-site with us and\ntested our daily build. At first, we sent our Friday build every week to the\nrest of their QA group, but in the last two months before submission we Fedex’ed\nthem our builds, daily. We also set up remote access to their bug database and\nused that as our sole bug reporting and resolution mechanism. Since changes to\nthe database would show up on the client GUI instantly, we would be alerted to\nthe new bugs as they arrived and could investigate and update the database entry\nimmediately with comments or requests for closure.\n\nThe Crave QA group provided valuable console testing expertise, including\nexperience with a recent GameCube title, and were familiar with the Nintendo\ndeveloper guidelines. Soon after they started testing Whirl Tour, their GameCube\nbug database contained about 200 entries, many of them memory card and disc\nerror handling issues that would have been flagged by lot check at submission.\nBy the end of the project, we had around 700 bugs logged and resolved for Whirl\nTour GameCube.\n\n6. Schedule\nOriginally, we estimated the GameCube development of Whirl Tour would trail the\nPS2 by one to three months, for reasons including the expected delay for\nhardware and middleware and less in-house familiarity with the newer GameCube\nplatform versus the PS2. But that meant we would at least partially miss the\ncritical holiday retail season. When it appeared that we could deliver our first\nGameCube milestone on disc, it made sense to synchronize the GameCube schedule\nwith that of the PS2. This allowed us to target September for our North American\nsubmission, which would allow the game to arrive on the retail shelves in\nNovember. And it greatly simplified our overall project schedule, since we\ndidn’t have to track different milestones on each platform.\n\nThe decision to sync the schedules was consistent with our approach of top-down\nmilestone-driven scheduling. Instead of building the schedule bottom-up by\nsumming up low-level tasks, a method which accumulates error over time, we built\nthe schedule top-down, placing the most importance on critical deadlines like E3\nand the target submission date, followed by our milestone commitments to the\npublishers, and then juggling tasks to accomodate those dates. Adhering to the\nbig-picture deadlines proved even more important later in the project, when\nPapaya was gearing up for the next project — any delay in this title would have\njust propagated to the next.\n\nThe schedule was tracked with Microsoft Project. Milestones were marked as such\nusing the milestone task annotation in Project, and features required for each\nmilestone were listed as subtasks, down to a granularity of no less than one\nweek per task. We marked only real dependencies between tasks, no artificial\nlinks to force a nice-looking sequence, and we let Project calculate the\nexpected dates. When a task was completed, we filled in the date for the\nfinished task and let Project recalculate the dates for the remaining tasks.\nThus we used the schedule not so much as a micro-management and task-scheduling\ntool than as a schedule feasibility tracker and early warning system.\n\nWe had weekly team meetings that initially involved only the leads and proceeded\nin a go-around-the-table-and-report fashion. Eventually, the format changed to\ninclude all team members and followed an announced agenda. This resulted in more\nfocused and shorter meetings, sometimes lasting only fifteen or twenty minutes\nand rarely lasting more than an hour. Minutes were distributed by email\nafterwards. The meeting time was also minimized by requiring each team member to\nsend a company-wide status report every Friday on his area of the project.\n\nWhat Went Wrong\n1. Performance\nThe biggest disappointment was our failure to achieve our original performance\ntarget of 60fps for all levels in single-player mode. We did achieve the desired\n30fps for multiplayer mode in all levels, but for single-player mode we could\nonly maintain a consistent 60fps in two-thirds of the levels. The remaining\nlevels alternated between 30fps and 60fps, so we had to lock them to the lower\nframe rate to keep the visuals smooth.\n\nWe made a mistake in not achieving and maintaining the target frame rate early.\nWe started with a consistent 30fps in our first GameCube milestone, and the code\nperformance improved all the way through the project. We planned on achieving\n30fps for the first milestone and reaching 60fps by E3. The fact that we only\nhad a few levels running at 60fps by E3 should have been a wake-up call, but we\nsuccumbed to wishful thinking and hoped that further optimization techniques\nwould get us to our goal. We did improve code performance by about 50 percent\nbetween E3 and submission, but with more NPC’s, water effects, particle effects,\ndynamic shadows, and so on, we just kept pace with the additional assets. In the\nend, we still left a third of the levels below target in single-player mode.\n\nIt became apparent, too late, that many of our optimization techniques did not\nimprove the worst-case performance in our problematic levels. If we had\nrecognized this earlier, we may have been able to restructure the levels to\nexhibit more balanced performance. There were some architecture-specific\noptimizations that we did not fully explore, but again, we ran out of time.\n\n2. Submission (and Resubmission)\nThe NOA submission was rejected twice before approval. That isn’t a particularly\nbad showing, but there was a lot of pressure to get each resubmission out\nquickly, and it wasn’t fun. We cut it close in terms of getting the release out\nin time for the holiday retail season, so it would have been more comfortable if\nwe could have knocked it down to one or two submissions.\n\nThe most persistent problem areas that kept showing up on our lot check\nsubmission reports included memory card error handling and on-screen depictions\nof controller buttons. We could have gotten a pass on the button graphics, but\nwe updated the button graphics several times anyway in hopes of making them more\nacceptable to lot check. The memory card issues for the most part were not\nnegotiable — there are comprehensive guidelines involving error-handling flow\nand messages. These are not very exciting features to implement, but they are\nrequired, and we should have tried to get that stuff done earlier.\n\nOur programmers and testers were not familiar with the GameCube submission\nissues, and as a result, we were overly reliant on Crave’s QA team to identify\nthe problems. Once Crave started testing the game, we basically had two months\nto rewrite our memory card, disc error, and reset-handling code, while\nsimultaneously adding our shadow code, performance optimizations, and trying to\nfix all other bugs before submission. This was complicated by a couple of\nattempts in the last few weeks to advance the submission, which, in retrospect,\nnow seems unrealistic.\n\nWe should have educated ourselves on the submission issues much earlier by\nreading up on the guidelines and examining other games, and we should have\nscheduled completion of all the guideline requirements by our beta release early\nsummer. Crave sent the beta to lot check, but we didn’t receive the results\nuntil two weeks before the final submission. The presubmission report from lot\ncheck was useful, but would have been more so if we had tracked it down earlier,\nand if didn’t have so many violations (too many to fix in one pass).\n\nWe complicated the memory card situation by attempting to share much of the\nframework with the PS2. We delayed much of the GameCube-specific implementation\nuntil the PS2 code was nearly done, so most of the work was completed in the\nlast three months before submission. The code sharing seemed convenient\ninitially, but there were significant differences between memory card guidelines\nfor the two platforms. The resulting error-checking and error-handling flow was\nsomewhat atypical for a GameCube title, requiring clarification among the QA\ngroups, lot check, and programmers. After hasty code mangling during the\nresubmissions to accomodate QA and lot check objections, the shared code was a\nmess. It seems obvious now that we should have completely separated the memory\ncard code for the two platforms.\n\n3. Manual Builds\nAlthough we had a daily build, it was not automated. We performed the build on a\ndeveloper station using the ProDG/Visual Studio envronment. This allowed us to\nmake quick fixes before releasing the build to QA, but it was not the type of\nclean and reproducible build that good configuration management practices\nmandate. An overnight batch build would have saved time (each build took\nanywhere from 30 minutes to three hours, depending on fixit attempts), been\nreproducible, and, if we set it up properly, automatically logged and emailed\nbuild results.\n\nMoreover, an automatic build could have helped to establish a sense of\nregularity and process. The team members were never sure when the next build\nwould be available, so eventually we had to send email every day announcing the\nbuild. Aside from the testers, most of our team members were still overly\nreliant on the PC version on the game and there was a slightly disruptive\ntendency to go straight to the programmers instead of checking the latest\nofficial build. And the fact that the build took place manually and not at any\ndesignated regular time made it too tempting to request new builds at increasing\nand irregular intervals, particularly during crunch times.\n\nWe had our data converter running every night by the end of the project,\nallowing us to check the latest art and sound effects changes. But the data\nbuild did not include processing of songtrack and FVM data, which were provided\nby external sources as WAV and AVI files requiring lengthy (hours to do a whole\nset) conversion to GameCube-specific compressed streaming formats. The FMV\nconversion was particularly involved, as we required versions for NTSC and PAL,\nand we had to extract the audio, resample and merge it back in to the converted\nFMV files. Unfortunately, the songtrack and FMV sources arrived fairly late in\nour schedule, so we were processing iterations of this data well past our\nattempted one-month data freeze before submission.\n\n4. Wanted: Tool Programmer\nWe could have used a tool programmer. Our data converter was augmented by\nseveral different programmers in an ad-hoc manner, so new features were not\nconsistently implemented with all the target platforms in mind. For example,\nalthough mipmapping and texture compression were technically multi-platform\nfeatures, the code ended up in an “ngc-utils” file, and triangle-strip\ngeneration and texture palettization ended up in PS2-only code. A dedicated tool\nprogrammer could have developed the converter with more of a big-picture\napproach and taken some of the load off the other programmers, particularly the\nconsole programmers and lead programmer. A dedicated tool programmer could also\nhave addressed the artists requests for previewing tools, which we just didn’t\nhave time to work on.\n\n5. Lengthy Localization\nThe localization process for the European release took a lot longer than\nexpected. Crave’s QA group was regularly testing our PAL builds well before the\nNOA submission, so we expected to have a submission to NOE ready as soon as we\nhad the text translations. The game engine modifications turned out to involve\nnew texture fonts for the extended character set, additional character\nselections for text entry screens, resized GUI elements so longer European words\nwould fit, and proper synchronization of the in-game language with the console\nROM language setting. The code changes took a while, but a greater delay was\nincurred by an initial one-month wait for the first set of translations from\nVivendi, then several iterations with Vivendi’s QA group to fix translations,\ntypos, and text trailing off screen. We made our submission to NOE three months\nafter the NOA submission, and then it took an additional three weeks for NOE to\nreject the first submission and approve the second.\n\n6. A Mild Case of Featuritis?\nWe didn’t completely meet our performance targets, and we had a crunch time\ninvolving a flurry of fixes and resubmissions. So any work that didn’t result in\nobviously necessary functionality warrants reevaluation:\n\nAudio Effects\nWe had audio reverb and delay effects on our requirements checklist, but they\nwere used in only one area in the game. It was gratifying to say we used the\naudio effects hardware on the GameCube, but it made our audio code layer\nsignificantly more complex and took several weeks to get it right. Compounding\nthis, we were worried about the audio DSP dropping voices when oversubscribed,\nso after E3 we rewrote the system to handle this eventuality. But the rewrite\ntook two to three weeks, the resulting code was messier, and once we had all the\nsounds in the game, the built-in GameCube metering hardware indicated that we\nwere only using twenty five percent of the DSP cycles in the worst case.\n\nScreen Capture\nWe had a publisher requested for a screen snapshot function, which we\nimplemented shortly after the first GameCube milestone. It worked only on a\ndevkit and was used by our testers for their bug reports. But it’s unlikely that\nit was used by anyone else, internally or externally. Submission releases were\nnot supposed to include debug code, so we ended up removing the screen snapshot\ncode before the presubmission. All in all, we spent five months maintaining that\nfeature.\n\nVideo Modes\nNintendo recommended but did not require support for progressive scan. We\nimplemented it, but neither we nor our publisher’s QA group had progressive scan\nmonitors, so we relied on informal testing off-site using personal equipment.\nOur progressive scan support was noted by some reviewers, but there was a cost\nin coding, testing, and added risk to the submission, as Nintendo has guidelines\non proper implementation of progressive scan.\n\nSimilarly, Nintendo recommended but did not require support for 60Hz mode in PAL\nreleases. The number of users who can take advantage of this feature is probably\nhigher than with progressive scan, and this feature was testable in-house and by\nthe publisher’s QA group, so it is a more justifiable feature But again, there\nwas a development and QA cost, code complexity to handle both 50Hz and 60Hz\nmodes, e.g. in selecting the appropriate FMV to play, and additional\nlocalization required for text displayed when switching modes.\n\nShadows\nWe implemented detailed dynamic shadows for player characters and enemy bosses.\nIf we had limited the detailed shadows to just the player characters and used\nblob shadows for the bosses, at least two more of the levels would have run at\n60fps instead of 30fps. It wouldn’t have looked as good, but would have been no\nworse than many high-profile games that have recently appeared. We used\nhigher-resolution shadow maps for the player characters, while allowing the boss\nshadows to have a more jagged appearance. The hi-res maps looked good, but the\neffect was subtle, and there may have been a performance penalty. Late in the\nproject, we combined the shadow map blending with a location-based shadow value\nso the dynamic shadows would blend with pre-shadowed areas. Yet again, this\nlooked good, but the effect was subtler still, and it was risky to make such a\nchange right around submission.\n\n7. IT\nOur server crashed right around E3, and although we had an automatic tape backup\nrunning every night, it turned out the data was unrecoverable. Fortunately, we\nhad local copies of the working data distributed around the office, and we had\nperformed periodic manual backups on DVD. It took a while to piece together all\nour code and assets, and some of the work done just before E3 was lost. It could\nhave been worse, but we did pay a the price for failing to ensure the integrity\nof our backup system.\n\nAfter the server crash, we spent the next several months upgrading our IT\ninfrastructure. This didn’t distract too much from the ongoing development work,\nbut we could have done a better job of minimizing disruptions by communicating\nand coordinating the IT plans. For example, switching from local accounts to\ndomain-based accounts made some development tools unusable until some Windows\nregistry values were updated. Even then, we were unable to upgrade our ProDG\ninstallation, which meant we were unable to upgrade the Nintendo SDK. And we had\nto use the original local account for our disk burns. We could have attempted to\ndiagnose the problems or at worst perform a complete reinstallation, but with\ncrunch time starting and the submission deadline looming, we really didn’t want\nto take the time. This might have been avoided if we had discussed the IT\nplanning in our weekly meetings and coordinated some upgrade tests and fallback\npolicies.\n\nLessons Learned\nThis article focused on the GameCube development of Whirl Tour, but most of\nthese issues are applicable to console development in general. As a console\ndeveloper, many things are outside of your control, so control what you can. Get\nthe development tools as soon as possible, and get more than enough. Make full\nuse of developer support. Achieve memory and performance targets early and\nmaintain them. Establish daily automated builds and testing early. Take care of\nthe requirements before working on bonus features. Schedule around the really\nimportant milestones and then stick with the schedule. Do early and multiple\npresubmissions if possible. Plan for a few resubmissions in the end — allow a\nmonth. And localization will take longer than you think.","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/04/Whirl_Tour.jpg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"draft","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2021-03-29T16:25:50.000Z","updated_at":"2022-02-09T20:19:20.000Z","published_at":"2021-03-29T16:26:44.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null},{"id":"606245b21b9ffb003bbf7b37","uuid":"ed731024-1326-456d-9804-e93763a53070","title":"Covid-19","slug":"covid-19","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"bookmark\",{\"type\":\"bookmark\",\"url\":\"https://theuscovidatlas.org/\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"https://uscovidatlas.org\",\"title\":\"US Covid Atlas\",\"description\":\"Near Real-Time Exploration of the COVID-19 Pandemic.

There’s no way I’m\ngoing to do anything with more than a few of them. But still, sometimes I fancy\na name, and yearly registration is less than the cost of…well, almost everything\nelse. So I register them on a whim and then try to figure out a use for them,\nlike pointing to my Medium page.\n\n“It’s hard to fondle penguins” is an inside joke interpretation of MIT’s\ninformal motto acronym “IHTFP” (though I’m sure it’s hardly exclusive to MIT).\nihtfp.com was already taken, so I registered itshardtofondlepenguins.com,\nbreaking my rule of only registering domains that are easy to type. I made that\nrule after working at a startup with digitalchameleon.com and discovering no one\nknew how to spell chameleon. So maybe it’s just a spelling rule.\n\nSome of my other domains:\n\nphilipchu.com — Again, not my first choice. I would have preferred philchu.com\nwhich is shorter, and for some reason, a lot of people misspell Philip\n(sometimes two l’s, and sometimes starting with an f, believe it or not). But\nthere are a lot of Philip Chu’s, so I still lucked out.\n\ntechnicat.com — that was my first domain, picked because I needed a name for my\nfirst domain. Yet again, it wasn’t really my first choice — I wanted\ntechnocat.com, which was taken, but by now I think technicat is just as good or\nbetter.\n\nfugugames.com — because I was watching a Food Network segment on fugu (the\npoisonous Japanese puffer fish delicacy) and thought that would make a good game\nlabel. Tasty, with a hint of danger. Also, I liked the alliteration.\n\nslowgamer.com — because I’m a slow gamer. Ask any game designer or tester I\nworked with.\n\nillusivity.com — this was a domain name I picked as a replacement for\ndigitalchameleon.com after a lawyer representing a Canadian comic book colorist\nsent us a letter. I registered it for myself recently when I saw it available\nbecause I still like it, although I have no memory of how I came up with the\nname.\n\nomoapps.com — like fugugames, you can blame TV for this one. I watch a lot of\nKorean drama, and the characters often utter “Omo!” which is kind of like OMG.\nSo I just thought omoapps sounded cool.\n\nwholebraingames.com — another game domain, this one is a form of protest against\none of my pet peeves, people talking about left-brain vs. right-brain. I’ve even\nseen an HBR Review article on it, but it’s unscientific and the type of stupid\nthing that right-brained people like to indulge in. Just kidding. But really, it\nis stupid. Also, I like how wholebraingames sounds.\n\ntalkdimsum.com — this is the closest one to a rationally derived domain name. I\nhave an iOS app that helps people order dim sum by displaying photos and\ndescriptions of dim sum dishes and providing Cantonese text-to-speech so they\ncan practice pronouncing the dishes. So I called it Talk Dim Sum.\n\nI have a few more, but some of them fall out of favor and I just let them\nexpire. The ones above I still have hopes for.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"status:free","created_at":"2021-03-31T18:17:21.000Z","updated_at":"2021-03-31T18:19:43.000Z","published_at":"2021-03-31T18:19:43.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":"6270d8fd981c6c00315c2cee"},{"id":"6064ff0c1b9ffb003bbf7b7e","uuid":"87bf03e7-dc63-456b-b903-88673268f29a","title":"Stand with Asian Americans","slug":"stand-with-asian-americans","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"bookmark\",{\"type\":\"bookmark\",\"url\":\"https://standwithasianamericans.com\",\"metadata\":{\"url\":\"http://standwithasianamericans.com\",\"title\":\"Stand with Asian Americans\",\"description\":\"We ask that you join us in ending discrimination and violence against the Asian community and all marginalized communities.

Since then I've added Vancouver, and I've\nlearned Flutter to develop the Android version.\n\nI’ve learned a lot from making my Talk Dim Sum [http://talkdimsum.com/] app.\n\nFor one, I learned some Cantonese, which was my original motivation for building\nthis app. I was consulting on a project in Hong Kong and discovered I don’t know\nthe language (turns out the few phrases I can understand from my parents like\n“time for dinner” can only get you so far). I started using the Cantonese\ntext-to-speech Voiceover support on my Mac to learn some pronunciation and\nthought, hmm, it would be cool to use that functionality on my iPhone.\n\nAnd naturally, I learned about dim sum. I chose dim sum because it was a nice\nlimited domain, and I figured I’d just take some photos once in a while when I\nwent out to dim sum. And in fact, I didn’t go out for dim sum that often for the\nfirst few years of the app’s development, even in Hong Kong, but 1) users\nstarted asking for specific additions, and 2) I moved to Las Vegas, which has\nnearly a dozen dim sum restaurants. I learned there are really a lot of dim sum\ndishes (the app currently has over 150 entries and there’s still plenty to go).\n\nI learned native iOS development. This was another initial motivation, as I was\nonly making mobile apps with Unity and figured I should branch out.\n\nI learned Xamarin, because I didn’t like Objective-C. I wasn’t that excited by\nC# either, but it’s alright, and I was using C# with Unity, so that’s\nconvenient. Also, F# looked intriguing, but I never got around to that.\n\nI learned Swift, because I figured, after it stabilized somewhat around version\n2, Swift is the future. And it’s not Objective-C. And I had some memory\nmanagement issues with Xamarin. And I was contemplating using Swift in the\nWordsEye app, so I wanted to try it out on my own app, first.\n\nI learned that it’s easier to get nice reviews from an app if it’s not a game\napp. I mean, I have some good reviews for HyperBowl, but hard-won, across\nseveral app stores and several years. It’s not as bad as the early App Store\nyears when it seemed everyone was a self-designated expert game designer, but\nit’s still a tough crowd. But for Talk Dim Sum, the ratio of ratings and reviews\nto downloads is much higher and generally more favorable. Maybe food is a\nspecial case. If the end result of an app’s use is a good meal, who wouldn’t\ngive five stars?\n\nI learned that the people most likely to give low ratings to a\nCantonese-learning app (partly because the speech is slowed down and uses iOS\ntext-to-speech and not proper recordings) are native Cantonese speakers who\nemigrated from Hong Kong (but for some reason, my ratings in Hong Kong itself\nare pretty good). Dude, this app is not for you.\n\nI learned that you don’t really know what features users want until you hear\nfrom them. Someone requested a save-favorite-dishes feature, which was fortunate\nbecause I was trying to think of a feature I could charge for via an in-app\npurchase. I had no intention of adding Mandarin speech (I figured you’re only\ngoing to hear Cantonese in a Hong Kong-style dim sum restaurant but actually\nthat’s not always true in the US), but someone asked for it. I only implemented\nmaps of restaurant locations because I wanted to learn how to implement maps,\nand it’s some insurance for getting the app approved (I’ve had apps rejected as\n“could easily be a web site instead, but if you incorporate Apple Maps we’ll\napprove it”). But then I got requests to add restaurants in New Jersey, Ottawa,\nand Houston. I was also holding off on a type-in search feature, because it\nseemed like a lot of work, but someone requested it, so, oh, all right, I’ll do\nit (took a few days).\n\nI learned that the stereotype of Canadians being always polite is a myth.\nSomeone in Vancouver was all-caps incensed that I didn’t include restaurants in\nVancouver (I still haven’t, but if you want to suggest some favorites, I’ll add\nthem!)\n\nI learned that dim sum is a niche app category. I’m pretty sure my app is tops\namong dim sum apps, but that’s not actually saying much. There are a few other\ndim sum apps, and one or two of them are pretty good, but none are actively\nmaintained. I imagine they’re typical cases where they contracted a developer,\npaid for development of the initial release, and decided not to throw any more\nmoney at it. It’s easier for a self-publishing one-person shop like me. I can\nwork on it as long as I feel like it.\n\nI learned that users appreciate frequent updates, especially when they see\nchanges in response to their requests or bug reports. Actually, I knew this\nalready, but it’s more difficult with games, when a user request is “add\nmultiplayer.” And I theorize that users develop more initial interest and a\nbetter impression if they see an active version history in the App Store\n(especially if they’re not boring Facebook-like “Fixed bugs” for each of the\nreleases).\n\nFinally, I learned that if you make an app that you think could be fun and/or\nuseful, even if it’s mostly to learn and not so much that you really really need\nit for yourself, there’s a good chance others will like it, too.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"status:free","created_at":"2021-04-02T06:06:24.000Z","updated_at":"2021-04-02T06:09:44.000Z","published_at":"2021-04-02T06:09:44.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":"6270d8fd981c6c00315c2cee"},{"id":"6066c1301b9ffb003bbf7c01","uuid":"a299b63a-0da0-4e5a-8f3e-f003cb376e0c","title":"Dim Sum Email","slug":"dim-sum-e-ail","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"http://talkdimsum.com/\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"When I got rid of the Facebook pages I was using for app support, I reluctantly added an email support link to my \"],[0,[0],1,\"Talk Dim Sum\"],[0,[],0,\" app (reluctantly, because I’ve received so much spam from the app support email addresses for my games on Google Play), but actually I got some good feedback on it, including this one:\"]]],[1,\"blockquote\",[[0,[],0,\"Just writing to thank you for your wonderful dim sum, etc photos that have to do with a chinese meal.

But even with the fine and nuanced performances supplied by the actors,\nthey seem remote and inaccessible. The more sympathetic characters are the\nsupporting ones, such as the devious yet lively fake money courier played by\nJohn Turturro.\n\nBut LA’ers are known to be cold and superficial (as I’ve heard newly-arrived\nMidwesterns and Southerners say), so it does feel right, along with the many\noutdoor shots of not-so-pretty LA where the kidnappings, robberies, pursuits,\nfights and other mayhem ensues. Although strong themes run thoughout this film —\nthe thin line between enforcing the law and breaking it, ambition and\nfrustration, the circle of people using each other — the highlight of the film\nis the action. The fights are authentically brutal and messy, the pursuits on\nfoot look exhausting (even more so in the “making of” featurette on the DVD),\nand the car chase is one of the best ever on film (ranking right up there with\nthe famous one in The French Connection).\n\nIn the director’s commentary, Friedkin deliberately avoids discussion of much\ndetail or interpretation of the film (which is a bit maddening since the end\nseems to bring up and leave open a lot of questions), but instead focuses on his\nphilosophy of filmmaking and how he put the film together. The account is far\nfrom dry, however, and includes quite a few interesting anecdotes. That thread\nis continued almost seamlessly into the making-of featurette, which thankfully\nimparts the history of the film in more of an Actor’s Studio style than a\npromotional clip.\n\nIn a nice turnabout from the usual, the alternate ending included on the DVD is\nthe dumbed down version pushed by the studio — that ending is so idiotic, it is\na relief to know that for once the director’s cut is the one that made it into\nthe theaters. Also atypical, the deleted scene featured on the DVD is one that\nwas cut entirely at the director’s discretion, and Friedkin admits in all candor\nin the associated commentary that his deletion was a mistake and he wishes he\ncould reintegrate it back into the film.\n\nAltogether, it’s a nice, fast trip back to the 80’s, even if Wang Chung is not\nyour cup of tea. The film may feel short, but the DVD bonus features compensate\nand are well worth viewing.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"status:free","created_at":"2021-04-02T18:23:32.000Z","updated_at":"2021-04-02T18:24:11.000Z","published_at":"2021-04-02T18:24:11.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":"6270d8fd981c6c00315c2cee"},{"id":"606766981b9ffb003bbf7c93","uuid":"b5aeb636-f0ad-4343-b8d0-aa98f990408b","title":"Wickwood","slug":"wickwood","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[[\"em\"]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[0],1,\"Feb 27, 2017\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"I’ve rewatched my John Wick Blue-Ray enough I figured I should catch the sequel on the big screen (especially since I live near one of those luxury theaters), and John Wick: Chapter Two did not disappoint.

And it doesn’t pay startlingly well, at least compared to other forms of software and media production.</p><p>So why would anyone want to be a game developer? And how do you motivate and retain game developers once you’ve got them on your project?</p><p>Well, game companies typically list “a passion for games” as a prerequisite in their employment ads. Perhaps this is the key — if game developers are also gamers, we may be able to apply game design principles to attracting and motivating game developers. After all, with game projects, as with games, we want to attract participants, inspire them to work through and complete the endeavor, then come back for another round.</p><p>In this article, we see how far we can stretch this analogy by applying some game design principles to game project management. The principles are selected from the introductory chapter of Richard Rouse’s book Game Design: Theory and Practice. They are listed in their original order and with their original titles and categories, but are paraphrased for brevity.</p><h2 id=\"why-do-players-play\">Why Do Players Play?</h2><p>Our initial query was: What draws game developers to this industry?</p><p>This is an appropriate first question to ask when designing a game. What brings game players to video games over other forms of entertainment? In other words, let’s figure out what are the unique offerings of video games so we can capitalize on them.</p><p>Likewise, game developers could easily be working in other fields, other types of software development or media production. So once we realize the unique attractions of the game business, we can leverage them.</p><h3 id=\"players-want-a-challenge\">Players Want a Challenge</h3><p>Game players enjoy facing challenges in games, especially single-player games. These challenges entertain, provide intellectual stimulation, and teach lessons that can be applied to other problem-solving situations.</p><p>Developers also seek challenges. Not challenges in the form of how-may-bugs-can-I-fix or how-many-hours-can-I-go-without-sleep, but, as in games, challenges that are intrinsically enjoyable and result in knowledge that can be applied in the future. Programmers want to implement cutting-edge algorithms that exploit the latest hardware yet operates within those hardware constraints. Artists want to create the best-looking models and animation within their given asset budgets. Game designers want to create entertaining and addictive gameplay experience through story, AI and level design.</p><p>Developers also have a pragmatic motive for intellectually and creatively extending themselves. Career longevity depends on staying current with the latest tools and technologies (ask all the developers who were slow to make the transition from 2D to 3D). Game companies are constantly looking for experience with the newest generation of consoles, and developers are always eager to work on the latest hardware.</p><h3 id=\"players-want-to-socialize\">Players Want to Socialize</h3><p>Long before their appearance on computer hardware, games have mostly been social activities. Social computer games range from Quake-style fragfests with players typing insults to each other in the heat of battle, to massively multiplayer persistent worlds featuring chat-style interaction.</p><p>In my experience, even single-player games take place in a social environment, either in taking turns, watching others play, and kibitzing. Certainly in the heydey of arcade games, you could see crowds gather around superb players. And a visit to any of the countless web-based game forums will show that gamers argue vehemently about the merits of their favorite games as much as any sports fanatic.</p><p>Likewise, many employees want a socially engaging workplace, where they can learn from their coworkers, banter and sometimes compete with them. Some companies have company picnics and Friday afternoon beer socials. Game developers have after-hours fragfests (which blurs the distinction between game development and game play even further).</p><h3 id=\"players-want-a-dynamic-solitaire-experience\">Players Want a Dynamic Solitaire Experience</h3><p>On the other hand, sometimes players like to play games by themselves, either because no one else is around, or the player wants a dynamic interactive experience without the hassles of dealing with (real) people.</p><p>Even in a social workplace, most employees need some time to themselves to get their work done. This is particularly true of programmers, who need to do a lot of thinking, (paired-programming aside) but everyone needs to don the headphones during some stretch of the day to get work done.</p><p>In a larger sense, the workplace also offers the developers refuge from the people of their “regular” lives — spouses, children, friends, pets. (I had one manager who, at 5pm, would start moving from office to office, ostensibly to talk with people, while his wife called random numbers to track him down.)</p><p>Then there are those who don’t want their work hours to encroach on their non-work life. These employees prefer minimal distraction and regular work hours so they can get home in time for dinner with the family, attend evening classes, play in a rock band, or engage in whatever other activities that constitute their personal lives.</p><h3 id=\"players-want-bragging-rights\">Players Want Bragging Rights</h3><p>Playing to win means getting respect from fellow players and bragging rights over them. This bragadaccio is evident in multiplayer fragfests, organized game competitions, and the high-score tables on game screens dating back to the early arcade games. This earned respect also includes self-respect — completing games and winning, even against the computer, can inject a shot of self-esteem into someone who might be athletically, socially or academically less accomplished.</p><p>Developers would like to brag that they worked on the latest smash-hit AAA title, worked for game companies that are household names, worked with game industry luminaries such as John Carmack or Will Wright. Even just mentioning you’re in the game business is a good conversation starter just about anywhere. I’ve worked in half a dozen different industries, but only since I started developing video games (even lesser-known titles), have I gotten a reliably enthusiastic response from laymen, including the guy at Starbucks. When I was working on manufacturing software, on the other hand, talking about my work inevitably resulted in a glassy-eyed stare, even from fellow programmers.</p><p>Part of the thrill in working on a game is seeing your name in the credits. I don’t really like the idea of displaying credits in a game — it certainly isn’t a common practice in other types of software, and it can easily be seen as an unfair and arbitrary process (in the film industry, it has political to the point where there are union rules about film credits). But it does seem to provide motivation and is important for career advancement in the game industry (many game job ads list credits on shipping titles as a requirement).</p><h3 id=\"players-want-an-emotional-experience\">Players Want an Emotional Experience</h3><p>Compared to other media such as film and literature, games usually exhibit limited emotional range, but at the very least all games attempt to produce excitement and a sense of accomplishment in game players.</p><p>Game developers want to experience those emotions in game development, too. Ideally, developers should feel an increasing level of adrenalin rush and anticipation as the project nears completion, and the gold submission should be accompanied by a profound sense of achievement. Pace is important — the end of the project should be the most gratifying, not anticlimactic.</p><p>Good emotions: interest, confidence, anticipation, excitement, satisfaction. Bad emotions: frustration, nervousness, disappointment, anger, ennui.</p><h3 id=\"players-want-to-fantasize\">Players Want to Fantasize</h3><p>Games take players away from their normal lives by immersing them in fictional environments and circumstances. As in the movies, the game world is idealized — with the exception of The Sims, you’re not bothered by household chores, taxes, and addressing bodily functions.</p><p>In the workplace, of course, you still have to deal with bodily functions and taxes, but a job still offers a world separate from the home life and roles and missions that are different and possibly more exciting than available in the personal life. To different degrees, companies are like role-playing games in assigning employees to different official categories — game designer, producer, programmer, artist. Startup companies with more loosely defined responsibilities allow employees to assume a “be all you can be” attitude.</p><h2 id=\"what-do-players-expect\">What Do Players Expect?</h2><p>Now that we’ve established what motivates people to become game developers, it’s time to address the second part of our query. Once we’ve got a developer on our project, how do we keep him present, happy and motivated?</p><p>In game design, we have the same issue — once a player has decided to play a game, he has expectations that must be fulfilled for him to enjoy and complete the game, so it is important to identify those expectations, conscious or not.</p><h3 id=\"players-expect-a-consistent-world\">Players Expect a Consistent World</h3><p>Players expect their actions in a game to have predictable results. Not right in the beginning — the player has to experiment a bit, in the way that infants do learn about their environment, to understand how things work in the game world. Seemingly arbitrary cause-and-effect will discourage the player and give the impression that the game is rigged.</p><p>In a game development setting, motivational pats on the back and even concrete rewards like raises and bonuses will not have the intended effect if the developer cannot understand how to get those rewards. Even worse are unpredictable punishments — if working harder or taking extra responsibility results in censure, then the developer will adopt a fatalistic and passive attitude. In some extreme cases, I’ve seen employees refuse to do anything until explicitly given an order or perform deliberately bad work.</p><h3 id=\"players-expect-to-understand-the-world%E2%80%99s-bounds\">Players Expect to Understand the World’s Bounds</h3><p>In games, players expect to recognize boundaries on actions and movement. Visual cues such as walls and precipices indicate the world’s physical boundaries. The available controller actions constrain physical actions, e.g. some games have no jump button.</p><p>In the workplace, the employee wants to know the boundaries, too (they may think they don’t want to have boundaries, but at the very least, they need to know the ones that do exist). For legal reasons, corporations often communicate boundaries on acceptable workplace behavior through orientations for new employees, employment handbooks explaining company policy, and, when they’re particularly nervous about it, various forms of “sensitivity” training.</p><p>But all the legalese is ineffective without visible enforcement. Termination or other corrective actions will signal to everyone that the offending behavior, whether it be sexual harrassment or just talking back to the boss, is out of bounds. Letting the behavior go will either lead to ambiguity or signal tacit approval.</p><p>Boundaries also include organizational boundaries. Game projects typically provide the publisher with a project document listing key roles and responsibilities of the development staff. This type of documentation is also useful to the team, so they have an idea who’s in charge of what and who reports to whom. Management often finds it convenient to keep these roles vague, which has the advantage of providing some flexibility, but doing this for political reasons will just result in confusion and recriminations.</p><h3 id=\"players-expect-reasonable-solutions-to-work\">Players Expect Reasonable Solutions to Work</h3><p>After gaining some experience with a game, the player has idea how to solve problems in the game. The player will be frustrated and irritated if any reasonable solutions based on the gameplay so far turn out to be ineffective. So designers should take care to accomodate such solutions even if they are not the primary solutions intended by the designer.</p><p>Game developers also expect reasonable solutions to work (how many times have you heard, why doesn’t this work?) Game development is often at the cutting edge in terms of technology and scale, so oftentimes techniques that “should” work, don’t. Even, tools and middleware and equipment for game development are notoriously flakey.</p><p>So it is important to ensure that everything within control works like it should. The devkits provided by the console makers may arrive late and crash frequently, but the commodity hardware and software (desktop and server computers, email, backup software, for example) should be rock solid. Compilers, debugging tools, and game engine middleware are often inadequately documented and in a beta state, so the production pipeline and internal tools should be well documented. The smoothest-running game projects I’ve seen still had plenty of mystery code, halting production pipelines, and IT glitches like servers crashing, data irretrievably lost, and ill-timed upgrades during crunch times.</p><h3 id=\"players-expect-direction\">Players Expect Direction</h3><p>A game should give some indication of the the player’s objectives. Otherwise the player may roam the game aimlessly wondering what to do, randomly attacking objects, NPC’s and other players just to see if something will happen. Game developers can also roam around a game project aimlessly. In the worst case, they will break other developer’s code and art, and bitch, moan and complain.</p><p>Everyone wants to know what the game is about. What’s the story? What type of gameplay are we trying to achieve? How does it fit in and compete with other titles on the market? This is what a high-concept documents is supposed to communicate, and this document should be readily available in-house as well as distributed to publishers. If you can’t convince your own team of the viability of the game vision, then it’s much less likely you can persuade publishers, their marketing staff, and retailers to buy into that vision.</p><p>Direction is also provided by the schedule. The final release date and interim milestones, including specification of the critical features required at each point, should be clear, reliable and changed only in drastic situations that warrant changing the entire schedule. In other words, the milestones and release dates should not be moving targets.</p><p>Scheduling is often performed down to a fine-grained level, in some cases to tasking day by day by day or even by hours. But while some developers may require micromanagement, it is important to make a distinction between this kind of supervision and a global schedule that the entire organization needs to be working toward. A day-to-day or even weekly schedule is volatile — vacations, sick days, emergency bugs and demos, server crashes and other natural disasters happen. Some tasks take longer than expected and some turn out to be easier than anticipated, and sometimes it makes sense to reorder them, but overall they should average out to meet the scheduled milestones.</p><h3 id=\"players-expect-to-accomplish-a-task-incrementally\">Players Expect to Accomplish a Task Incrementally</h3><p>Players usually know the overall objective in the game but expect to achieve this objective via a succession of subgoals. This provides awareness of incremental progress and reassurance that the player is on track. Without this feedback, a player could go off course and not realize it.</p><p>Not only do game developers find completing subgoals more tractable than large monolithic tasks, subdividing large tasks is vital to risk management and project scheduling. Then progress can be measured and validated by monitoring the completion of these subtasks. When developers jump into general assignments such as implementing renderers, physics engines, AI without defining components and tests that can be completed in sequence, then such a project can drag on for months without visible progress, until it becomes apparent that it’s going in the wrong direction or that no progress is actually being made.</p><h3 id=\"players-expect-to-be-immersed\">Players Expect to Be Immersed</h3><p>Obtrusive user interfaces and game glitches, particularly crashes, distract from the player experience. And a character that is difficult to control or unappealing will also prevent the player from comfortably playing that role and feeling part of the game world.</p><p>In a game development environment, you also want each team member to feel immersed in the project and concentrate on getting the job done without distraction. Bureacratic and corporate artifacts should not intrude on what should be a project that is rewarding unto itself. For example, timecards and sign-in sheets, thick employee handbooks, administrative paperwork, will remind employees they are on the clock and working for “the man”. Instead, the necessary evils of running a business should be kept simple and to a minimum, and the environment should exude the exciting aspects of the game industry — the office should have plenty of games, industry magazines, posters, etc.</p><p>As far as providing a suitably appealing and easily assumable character to play, this does have a counterpart in the game project, too. Each developer plays a role (sometimes more than one) — an enjoyable role will be played with gusto, a distasteful role will be dreaded and performed without enthusiasm.</p><h3 id=\"players-expect-to-fail\">Players Expect to Fail</h3><p>Players want challenge, so naturally they expect to fail at some points in the game. Moreover, those failures should stem from inadequate or incorrect play, rather than “tricks” or “cheap shots” utilized by the game. And the game should start out easy and ramp up later in difficulty to avoid discouraging players before the reward of the gameplay becomes apparent.</p><p>Game developers are also in the business for a challenge (or at least they should be), so they cannot be held back by fear of failure. On the contrary, developers should learn from failure. Attempts to implement new algorithms, use new tools will almost certainly result in some failures, all as part of the learning process and should be anticipated in the schedule. (This area where breaking schedules down too far will diverge from reality — you don’t know how many different implementations of say, a dynamic shadow algorithm, you might try, but you should know when it has to be completely done).</p><p>These setbacks are acceptable as long as they are natural byproducts of the learning process, but aggravating if they are imposed by outside factors. Unrealistic schedules and frequent crunch times will leave room for less error while simultaneously increasing the number of mistakes. Unreliable hardware and tools…</p><p>As with a game, a game project should start out easy, so everyone gets in the flow and understands the rules — how to work with the production pipeline, how to work with the rest of the team.</p><h3 id=\"players-expect-a-fair-chance\">Players Expect a Fair Chance</h3><p>Although players expect to fail, they also expect a fair chance. Ideally, a player should be able to make it all the way through the game on the first attempt if no mistakes are made. This means that progress shouldn’t require trial and error — it should be possible to deduce a successful path through the game. If the player finds that the only way to progress in the game is through gessing from sets of random choices, then it will seem like a waste of time.</p><p>Game developers also will become frustrated if it seems they have no way to make decisions short of guessing.</p><h3 id=\"players-expect-to-not-need-to-repeat-themselves\">Players Expect to Not Need to Repeat Themselves</h3><p>Players get annoyed if they have to repeat any tedious or painful portions of the game. Hence the availability of game saves, and, in particular, checkpoint saves.</p><p>The most obvious analogy in game development is avoiding loss of work. Code, game assets, and even production documents should be frequently adn regularly checked into a source control system. And everything should be backed up periodically, with the archive media stored off site and test restores performed to verify the backup integrity. This will seem obvious to some and extreme to others, but data loss due to accidental erasure, hardware failures, and absent or faulty backups is all too common.</p><p>Another interpretation of this game design principle is that team members shouldn’t be duplicating work.

These employees prefer minimal distraction and regular work hours\nso they can get home in time for dinner with the family, attend evening classes,\nplay in a rock band, or engage in whatever other activities that constitute\ntheir personal lives.\n\nPlayers Want Bragging Rights\nPlaying to win means getting respect from fellow players and bragging rights\nover them. This bragadaccio is evident in multiplayer fragfests, organized game\ncompetitions, and the high-score tables on game screens dating back to the early\narcade games. This earned respect also includes self-respect — completing games\nand winning, even against the computer, can inject a shot of self-esteem into\nsomeone who might be athletically, socially or academically less accomplished.\n\nDevelopers would like to brag that they worked on the latest smash-hit AAA\ntitle, worked for game companies that are household names, worked with game\nindustry luminaries such as John Carmack or Will Wright. Even just mentioning\nyou’re in the game business is a good conversation starter just about anywhere.\nI’ve worked in half a dozen different industries, but only since I started\ndeveloping video games (even lesser-known titles), have I gotten a reliably\nenthusiastic response from laymen, including the guy at Starbucks. When I was\nworking on manufacturing software, on the other hand, talking about my work\ninevitably resulted in a glassy-eyed stare, even from fellow programmers.\n\nPart of the thrill in working on a game is seeing your name in the credits. I\ndon’t really like the idea of displaying credits in a game — it certainly isn’t\na common practice in other types of software, and it can easily be seen as an\nunfair and arbitrary process (in the film industry, it has political to the\npoint where there are union rules about film credits). But it does seem to\nprovide motivation and is important for career advancement in the game industry\n(many game job ads list credits on shipping titles as a requirement).\n\nPlayers Want an Emotional Experience\nCompared to other media such as film and literature, games usually exhibit\nlimited emotional range, but at the very least all games attempt to produce\nexcitement and a sense of accomplishment in game players.\n\nGame developers want to experience those emotions in game development, too.\nIdeally, developers should feel an increasing level of adrenalin rush and\nanticipation as the project nears completion, and the gold submission should be\naccompanied by a profound sense of achievement. Pace is important — the end of\nthe project should be the most gratifying, not anticlimactic.\n\nGood emotions: interest, confidence, anticipation, excitement, satisfaction. Bad\nemotions: frustration, nervousness, disappointment, anger, ennui.\n\nPlayers Want to Fantasize\nGames take players away from their normal lives by immersing them in fictional\nenvironments and circumstances. As in the movies, the game world is idealized —\nwith the exception of The Sims, you’re not bothered by household chores, taxes,\nand addressing bodily functions.\n\nIn the workplace, of course, you still have to deal with bodily functions and\ntaxes, but a job still offers a world separate from the home life and roles and\nmissions that are different and possibly more exciting than available in the\npersonal life. To different degrees, companies are like role-playing games in\nassigning employees to different official categories — game designer, producer,\nprogrammer, artist. Startup companies with more loosely defined responsibilities\nallow employees to assume a “be all you can be” attitude.\n\nWhat Do Players Expect?\nNow that we’ve established what motivates people to become game developers, it’s\ntime to address the second part of our query. Once we’ve got a developer on our\nproject, how do we keep him present, happy and motivated?\n\nIn game design, we have the same issue — once a player has decided to play a\ngame, he has expectations that must be fulfilled for him to enjoy and complete\nthe game, so it is important to identify those expectations, conscious or not.\n\nPlayers Expect a Consistent World\nPlayers expect their actions in a game to have predictable results. Not right in\nthe beginning — the player has to experiment a bit, in the way that infants do\nlearn about their environment, to understand how things work in the game world.\nSeemingly arbitrary cause-and-effect will discourage the player and give the\nimpression that the game is rigged.\n\nIn a game development setting, motivational pats on the back and even concrete\nrewards like raises and bonuses will not have the intended effect if the\ndeveloper cannot understand how to get those rewards. Even worse are\nunpredictable punishments — if working harder or taking extra responsibility\nresults in censure, then the developer will adopt a fatalistic and passive\nattitude. In some extreme cases, I’ve seen employees refuse to do anything until\nexplicitly given an order or perform deliberately bad work.\n\nPlayers Expect to Understand the World’s Bounds\nIn games, players expect to recognize boundaries on actions and movement. Visual\ncues such as walls and precipices indicate the world’s physical boundaries. The\navailable controller actions constrain physical actions, e.g. some games have no\njump button.\n\nIn the workplace, the employee wants to know the boundaries, too (they may think\nthey don’t want to have boundaries, but at the very least, they need to know the\nones that do exist). For legal reasons, corporations often communicate\nboundaries on acceptable workplace behavior through orientations for new\nemployees, employment handbooks explaining company policy, and, when they’re\nparticularly nervous about it, various forms of “sensitivity” training.\n\nBut all the legalese is ineffective without visible enforcement. Termination or\nother corrective actions will signal to everyone that the offending behavior,\nwhether it be sexual harrassment or just talking back to the boss, is out of\nbounds. Letting the behavior go will either lead to ambiguity or signal tacit\napproval.\n\nBoundaries also include organizational boundaries. Game projects typically\nprovide the publisher with a project document listing key roles and\nresponsibilities of the development staff. This type of documentation is also\nuseful to the team, so they have an idea who’s in charge of what and who reports\nto whom. Management often finds it convenient to keep these roles vague, which\nhas the advantage of providing some flexibility, but doing this for political\nreasons will just result in confusion and recriminations.\n\nPlayers Expect Reasonable Solutions to Work\nAfter gaining some experience with a game, the player has idea how to solve\nproblems in the game. The player will be frustrated and irritated if any\nreasonable solutions based on the gameplay so far turn out to be ineffective. So\ndesigners should take care to accomodate such solutions even if they are not the\nprimary solutions intended by the designer.\n\nGame developers also expect reasonable solutions to work (how many times have\nyou heard, why doesn’t this work?) Game development is often at the cutting edge\nin terms of technology and scale, so oftentimes techniques that “should” work,\ndon’t. Even, tools and middleware and equipment for game development are\nnotoriously flakey.\n\nSo it is important to ensure that everything within control works like it\nshould. The devkits provided by the console makers may arrive late and crash\nfrequently, but the commodity hardware and software (desktop and server\ncomputers, email, backup software, for example) should be rock solid. Compilers,\ndebugging tools, and game engine middleware are often inadequately documented\nand in a beta state, so the production pipeline and internal tools should be\nwell documented. The smoothest-running game projects I’ve seen still had plenty\nof mystery code, halting production pipelines, and IT glitches like servers\ncrashing, data irretrievably lost, and ill-timed upgrades during crunch times.\n\nPlayers Expect Direction\nA game should give some indication of the the player’s objectives. Otherwise the\nplayer may roam the game aimlessly wondering what to do, randomly attacking\nobjects, NPC’s and other players just to see if something will happen. Game\ndevelopers can also roam around a game project aimlessly. In the worst case,\nthey will break other developer’s code and art, and bitch, moan and complain.\n\nEveryone wants to know what the game is about. What’s the story? What type of\ngameplay are we trying to achieve? How does it fit in and compete with other\ntitles on the market? This is what a high-concept documents is supposed to\ncommunicate, and this document should be readily available in-house as well as\ndistributed to publishers. If you can’t convince your own team of the viability\nof the game vision, then it’s much less likely you can persuade publishers,\ntheir marketing staff, and retailers to buy into that vision.\n\nDirection is also provided by the schedule. The final release date and interim\nmilestones, including specification of the critical features required at each\npoint, should be clear, reliable and changed only in drastic situations that\nwarrant changing the entire schedule. In other words, the milestones and release\ndates should not be moving targets.\n\nScheduling is often performed down to a fine-grained level, in some cases to\ntasking day by day by day or even by hours. But while some developers may\nrequire micromanagement, it is important to make a distinction between this kind\nof supervision and a global schedule that the entire organization needs to be\nworking toward. A day-to-day or even weekly schedule is volatile — vacations,\nsick days, emergency bugs and demos, server crashes and other natural disasters\nhappen. Some tasks take longer than expected and some turn out to be easier than\nanticipated, and sometimes it makes sense to reorder them, but overall they\nshould average out to meet the scheduled milestones.\n\nPlayers Expect to Accomplish a Task Incrementally\nPlayers usually know the overall objective in the game but expect to achieve\nthis objective via a succession of subgoals. This provides awareness of\nincremental progress and reassurance that the player is on track. Without this\nfeedback, a player could go off course and not realize it.\n\nNot only do game developers find completing subgoals more tractable than large\nmonolithic tasks, subdividing large tasks is vital to risk management and\nproject scheduling. Then progress can be measured and validated by monitoring\nthe completion of these subtasks. When developers jump into general assignments\nsuch as implementing renderers, physics engines, AI without defining components\nand tests that can be completed in sequence, then such a project can drag on for\nmonths without visible progress, until it becomes apparent that it’s going in\nthe wrong direction or that no progress is actually being made.\n\nPlayers Expect to Be Immersed\nObtrusive user interfaces and game glitches, particularly crashes, distract from\nthe player experience. And a character that is difficult to control or\nunappealing will also prevent the player from comfortably playing that role and\nfeeling part of the game world.\n\nIn a game development environment, you also want each team member to feel\nimmersed in the project and concentrate on getting the job done without\ndistraction. Bureacratic and corporate artifacts should not intrude on what\nshould be a project that is rewarding unto itself. For example, timecards and\nsign-in sheets, thick employee handbooks, administrative paperwork, will remind\nemployees they are on the clock and working for “the man”. Instead, the\nnecessary evils of running a business should be kept simple and to a minimum,\nand the environment should exude the exciting aspects of the game industry — the\noffice should have plenty of games, industry magazines, posters, etc.\n\nAs far as providing a suitably appealing and easily assumable character to play,\nthis does have a counterpart in the game project, too. Each developer plays a\nrole (sometimes more than one) — an enjoyable role will be played with gusto, a\ndistasteful role will be dreaded and performed without enthusiasm.\n\nPlayers Expect to Fail\nPlayers want challenge, so naturally they expect to fail at some points in the\ngame. Moreover, those failures should stem from inadequate or incorrect play,\nrather than “tricks” or “cheap shots” utilized by the game. And the game should\nstart out easy and ramp up later in difficulty to avoid discouraging players\nbefore the reward of the gameplay becomes apparent.\n\nGame developers are also in the business for a challenge (or at least they\nshould be), so they cannot be held back by fear of failure. On the contrary,\ndevelopers should learn from failure. Attempts to implement new algorithms, use\nnew tools will almost certainly result in some failures, all as part of the\nlearning process and should be anticipated in the schedule. (This area where\nbreaking schedules down too far will diverge from reality — you don’t know how\nmany different implementations of say, a dynamic shadow algorithm, you might\ntry, but you should know when it has to be completely done).\n\nThese setbacks are acceptable as long as they are natural byproducts of the\nlearning process, but aggravating if they are imposed by outside factors.\nUnrealistic schedules and frequent crunch times will leave room for less error\nwhile simultaneously increasing the number of mistakes. Unreliable hardware and\ntools…\n\nAs with a game, a game project should start out easy, so everyone gets in the\nflow and understands the rules — how to work with the production pipeline, how\nto work with the rest of the team.\n\nPlayers Expect a Fair Chance\nAlthough players expect to fail, they also expect a fair chance. Ideally, a\nplayer should be able to make it all the way through the game on the first\nattempt if no mistakes are made. This means that progress shouldn’t require\ntrial and error — it should be possible to deduce a successful path through the\ngame. If the player finds that the only way to progress in the game is through\ngessing from sets of random choices, then it will seem like a waste of time.\n\nGame developers also will become frustrated if it seems they have no way to make\ndecisions short of guessing.\n\nPlayers Expect to Not Need to Repeat Themselves\nPlayers get annoyed if they have to repeat any tedious or painful portions of\nthe game. Hence the availability of game saves, and, in particular, checkpoint\nsaves.\n\nThe most obvious analogy in game development is avoiding loss of work. Code,\ngame assets, and even production documents should be frequently adn regularly\nchecked into a source control system. And everything should be backed up\nperiodically, with the archive media stored off site and test restores performed\nto verify the backup integrity. This will seem obvious to some and extreme to\nothers, but data loss due to accidental erasure, hardware failures, and absent\nor faulty backups is all too common.\n\nAnother interpretation of this game design principle is that team members\nshouldn’t be duplicating work. For example, timely communication and visibility\nof the code base should allow programmers to avoid redundant work and encourage\ncode sharing. The game design and requirements, production pipeline, and any\nproject and corporate procedures should be documented and easily accessible to\navoid inefficiency in explaining and learning.\n\nPlayers Expect to Not Get Hopelessly Stuck\nA game should not allow a player to get stuck in a position from which there is\nno chance to complete or win the game. For example, a player should not be able\nto jump into a while from which there is no escape, aside from quitting the\ngame. Either provide a way out or put the player out of his misery.\n\nDevelopers also resent ending up in situations where they can’t succeed, and\nrather than hit the Quit button, they may just sit there, resentful and\napathetic. If they feel they’re faced with unfair expectations given unrealistic\nschedules, unbounded features, late or scarce tools and assets, then they won’t\neven try. If a developer is just not capable enough to succeed, then there’s no\npoint in breeding resentment by letting him linger on.\n\nPlayers Expect To Do, Not to Watch\nRouse opines that players want to play, not watch cut scenes. While cut scenes\ncan be instrumental in communicating narrative and setting up new levels, the\nduration of cut scenes should be kept to a minimum. Games that rely on cut\nscenes rather than gameplay inevitably fail to keep the gamers’ attention.\n\nDevelopers don’t want to sit around and watch a game being put together — they\nwant to be part of the action. Everyone has opinions on games and would like to\ndevelop a game that they actually want to play. You can’t have game design by\ncommittee, but soliciting ideas from everyone will make them feel like part of\nthe creative process. Internal newsgroups or message boards can be used for\nexchanging ideas. Contents can be held for names. Songs voted on. Blog-style\ndeveloper journals can be kept for historical and promotional purposes.\n\nOne way for developers to feel part of the game is to literally make them part\nof the game, by modelling characters to resemble staffers, incorporating inside\njokes, recording project members’ voices for voiceovers — all of these will\npersonalize the game for them.\n\nPlayers Do Not Know What They Want, But They Know It When They See It\nOnce a game has reached a playable state, it is important to test it with real\nplayers and gauge their reactions. Focus groups cannot be relied upon to make\ngame design decisions — that would be too easy. Rather, it is incumbent upon the\ngame designer to observe their reactions and use observation and experience to\ndiscern what is and is not working in the game.\n\nSimilarly, employees may not be able to articulate precisely what they want in a\nworkplace or project. Putting up suggestion boxes and soliciting feedback in\nemployee reviews may elicit some useful ideas, but you’ll get a lot of advice on\nrunning the project that still doesn’t necessarily fix problems that are\ndisturbing them. There is no substitute for the scientific method — observe your\nteam dynamics, hypothesize about what’s fundamentally not working (or working),\nmake corresponding adjustments and verify your fixes work.\n\nA Never-Ending List\nBesides playtesting and following the rules described above, a game designer can\ncome up with any number of game design principles based on experience and\npersonal tastes.\n\nIn project management, also, the best rule of thumb is to use one’s own\npreferences. What kind of project do you want to work on? Why are you in the\ngame business, what attracts you to a project and what would be your\nexpectations? As they say, your mileage may vary, but if you at least design a\nproject that you would want to be part of, then you have something that appeals\nto at least one known type of person.\n\n *","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/04/gdtp2coverfrontmedium.jpg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"status:free","created_at":"2021-04-04T14:02:51.000Z","updated_at":"2021-04-11T16:21:29.000Z","published_at":"2021-04-04T14:03:23.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":"6270d8fd981c6c00315c2cee"},{"id":"606a3bca1b9ffb003bbf7d04","uuid":"5aca5578-3aa1-4639-9729-75b7e935226d","title":"Fortune 40 Under 40","slug":"fortune-40-under-40","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/04/91D76800-F71E-4D01-A90C-B8672F61095B.jpeg\",\"width\":4032,\"height\":3024}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Coincidentally, after reading the local weekly's 40 Under 40 list, I got this fortune in my Chinese takeout.

As I was recently\ngoogling for answers on stackoverflow, it occurred to me that Irix OpenGL\nlinking bug which took me over half a year to track down back in the min-90’s\n(it would have been longer if some SGI folks hadn’t seen us demoing a Windows\nversion of our product which prompted them to send us engineering help instead\nof more salespeople), would probably have been solved in an afternoon if we had\ntoday’s Internet back then.\n\nAnd look, I’m self-publishing games and apps developed on my own with a laptop\nin my living room instead of working in a huge team with expensive middleware on\nsoftware dictated by a publisher or corporate management. Although I still have\nto do the latter on occasion to pay the b8lls.\n\nBut not everything is better. For one thing, as an industry professional, the\noffice situation has gone steadily worse. (The other thing is interviewing, but\nI’ll save that for another article). When I started in the 80’s, it was\ncustomary to share an office, but it was an office, and usually with just one\nofficemate. At my first job with Texas Instruments, it was me in one corner of a\nlarge office and my officemate in the other corner. At MIT, I shared a smaller\noffice, and drink fridge, with a grad student. And also at the Space Telescope\nScience Institute, I had one officemate.\n\nBut one officemate is still one more than ideal, so I was pretty happy to get my\nown office at BBN, where that was standard. You might think, as “open office”\nadvocates are wont to say, that this results in introverted engineers shutting\ntheir doors and never communicating with others, but actually what happens is\nyou can get work done without listening to your officemate get in political\narguments or have long phone conversations, and you can actually hold\nspontaneous meetings in your office (only awkward when someone I interviewed\nwith called during one of those meetings).\n\nBut that was in the mid-90’s and the beginning of the end. BBN with its new\nmanagement from IBM and Internet-centric focus proudly announced their new “open\noffice environments” which turned out to be cubicles. Perhaps that also signaled\na new emphasis on marketing-speak.\n\nFrom there, it was downhill. I moved to LA and shared a large office with two\nothers at a small company in LA, still considered crowded at the time but not\ntoo bad. It was pretty much impossible to conduct business phone conversations,\nthough, so I ended up conducting my weekly phone meetings with Franz (not the\nguy’s name, but our Lisp compiler vendor) at home before coming into work. So\nwhen I read about CEOs who have no office like everyone else at work, I say,\nyeah, right.\n\nThen I moved to Silicon Valley and my non-cubicle run was finally over. It was a\nbubblelicious time, so we did upgrade to super cubicles, importing ceiling high\ncustom wood-with-sliding-glass-door cubes from Canada which made me feel even\nmore exposed like a panda at the zoo, so I tried covering up the door with Buffy\nthe Vampire Slayer and Dr. Evil posters, but the CEO ordered them taken down\n(I’m not sure which was the offending poster, or both).

Other industries don’t do this — you don’t see ads requiring “a passion for factory automation software” or “a passion for working on banking systems”. Anyway, a devotion to games doesn’t necessarily translate to productivity and work ethic.</p><p>Most of the game developers I’ve worked with were avid gamers but many, including one of the best gamers I’ve ever met, didn’t apply the same concentration and motivation to their work. I’ve seen plenty of work with obvious defects, even an FMV with a two-second blank gap, either due to inattention or laziness (one artist even told me his video package could not reexport his FMV in AVI format, until I stated that was the only format I could process for our target console — then he promptly reexported it).</p><p>I’ll take professionalism over passion any day. If you need to hire janitorial staff, you’re not going to look for some crazy nut who has a passion for toilets — you want responsible people who take pride in doing their job.</p><p>Most of the best game artists I’ve worked with were only moderately interested in gaming — they were artists first and their results far surpassed those of mediocre artists with high gaming skills. They were conscientious enough to play-test their work during development but once the games were released, typically never touched them again.</p><p>Now, game design is one area where presumably an absorption in games would be really useful. But even there, you’ll find the best game designers are who have the intellectual breadth and analytical ability to figure out what makes a game fun and to move beyond knockoffs of existing games.</p><p>A common entry route to game development is via QA groups, and I think that is a good one — testing is a good introduction to the game development process without getting in the critical path, and anyone who can’t develop the patience and analytical abilities for that role is probably going to do a worse job in a production position.</p><p>To put a final point on this, if a passion for gaming is so important for game development, why are so many non-gamers in high-level decision-making positions on game projects? Many, if not most, of the high-level producers I’ve met are mediocre gamers at best, and it gets worse as you go up the corporate ladder.</p><p>I know of one game prototype that had all kinds of pizzazz thrown in at the producer’s request, and then the whole thing had to be scaled down at the last minute so the demo wouldn’t confuse the executives who had final approval. (Of course, the producers should have known this)</p><h3 id=\"programmers-are-from-mars-artists-are-from-venus\">Programmers are from Mars, Artists are from Venus</h3><p>The production pipeline is always the bottleneck, so you need people who not only work well, but work well in the context of a production.</p><p>Even some experienced and talented game artists do not work well in game development teams. Just throwing assets over the wall and assuming the programmers will fix it wastes time and engenders hostility from the programming team. The more difficult artists I’ve met were stubborn to the point of belligerence and considered the rest of the game team as staff supporting (or limiting) their artistic accomplishments.</p><p>Some phrases that have lost their novelty — “I didn’t change anything”, “It’s broken — fix it!”, “That’s how it works in 3D Studio Max”.</p><p>And while programmers often grouse with justification that artists aren’t feeding suitable data into the production pipeline, it is incumbent upon them to provide the proper guidance, in the form of clear documentation and explanation.</p><p>Programmers often don’t like to commit to numbers early, but artists and game designers need reliable asset budgets to do their job within the proper constraints, just as programmers need to know the hardware and delivery constraints. If artists and designers actually ask for budgets and guidance on how to optimize assets, then by all means accomodate them.</p><h3 id=\"the-producers\">The Producers</h3><p>Producers can be useful, if they’re not puffed up by the term “producer”. They’re the only the part of the production pipeline that doesn’t actually produce anything (except those producers who produce funding — they get to be called “executive producers”). A better term would be “facilitator”.</p><p>In the worst case, a producer will just cause more work for everyone else. The last thing a game project needs is a high-maintenance producer.</p><p>I was once plagued by a throng of producers who would hold daily status meetings, carry around lists of tasks and ask everyone to update the number of hours remaining per task on the lists (none of which matched), and stroll around asking, “So…what are you working on?” After may of the producers were laid off due to tightened funding, the project ran more smoothly.</p><p>But a knowledgable producer who is focused on keeping things running smoothly is indispensable.</p><p>I was vastly relieved that a survivor of the aforementioned layoff was an assistant producer who did a fantastic job of keeping on top of things. Every time I needed clarification on a game feature, he had the answer, knew where to get it, or could make a reasonable call on the spot. In any case, I had an answer within minutes. And he was the guy who ordered all the late-night meals.</p><p>At least producers in development shops have an idea what it actually takes to make a game. Producers who’ve only worked for publishers are less knowledgable and more self-important.</p><p>One stupid publisher trick: planting a producer at a developer’s office during crunch time to make sure they’re all working late into the night. When I showed one of these producers, who was camped out in my office during one of these crunches, the set of game design, production and business books on my shelf, he commented his boss had recommended he read some of them. And then he kicked me out of my office so he could have it to himself.</p><h2 id=\"think-inside-the-box\">Think Inside the Box</h2><p>“Think outside the box” is an oft-misused mantra. Questioning your underlying assumptions brings about innovation. Just making stuff up is a waste of time.</p><p>In high school, I joined other students who wanted to pad their college applications by competing in a statewide brainstorming competition, where we attempted to outdo each other in constructing the most fantastic scenarios possible. Odds favored those who most lost touch with reality.</p><p>What separates game artists and programmers from their brethren in other fields is the ability to create for resource-constrained platforms.</p><h3 id=\"screen-size\">Screen Size</h3><p>Take into account the screen size. For PC games, you have to decide how many standard PC monitor resolutions, refresh rates, color depths, and full-screen vs. windowed modes you’re going to support, and be sure to test the game with those settings. Even with console games, you may have more than one setting to worry about. If your game will be in both the US and Europe, then you need to handle both NTSC and PAL, which have different screen resolutions, with corresponding aspect ratios and memory requirements, and different refresh rates, which may affect any game behavior dependent on per-frame computation. And there are other modes like EURGB60, M-PAL, 480p (progressive scan) and multiple levels of HDTV.</p><h3 id=\"preprocess-everything\">Preprocess Everything</h3><p>Data created by game artists and designers eventually gets converted into formats usable on the target platforms. PC game engines often defer this conversion until runtime for convenience, but for consoles, where memory is comparatively limited, loading from disc is slower, and the main CPU may be relatively underpowered, it is important to have as much data preparation and optimization done offline as possible. Even for PC games, while developers may be lulled by the latest and greatest in PC hardware, there is still a customer base with configurations a few years old, and if they were budget PC’s then, imagine how limited they are now.</p><h3 id=\"get-lots-of-hardware\">Get Lots of Hardware</h3><p>Game development schedules are always tight, and even expensive hardware is cheap compared to personnel cost and the cost of missing a milestone and having your project cancelled, or missing the holiday retail season and losing out on those sales. Cutting-edge hardware, especially console development kits, is notoriously fragile, so you want to have extra units on hand if and when the hardware fails.</p><p>Almost every time I’ve worked on a console game, the game development hardware malfunctioned at some point and had to be sent back to the console maker for repair. In each case, the turnaround time was no more than two weeks, but two weeks on a crunch time project with monthly milestone deliverables is crucial. Fortunately, the developers always had on hand an extra kit that could be repurposed from less critical tasks.</p><p>Another reason to have redundant development hardware is to identify bugs that are due to glitchy hardware versus those present in your game.</p><p>Near the end of one console project, I ran into crashes of our game that occurred after several hours of the game running idle. Since we had multiple test kits, I could run several soak tests in parallel and isolate the crashes to one unit, and thereby conclude that it was a test hardware problem (and it was verified later that some units were known to have overheating issues)</p><p>Console games have the advantage that you only need to verify proper operation on a very limited set of configurations. For PC games you should have a variety of different hardware, operating systems, and various configurations for testing your game. This is true for cell phone games, too — phone models vary in screen size and color resolution, refresh rate, memory, etc.</p><p>I nearly missed one Windows compatibility issue with a PC game after Microsoft introduced a service pack that removed support for a video codec that we used for an FMV (in fact, the codec was used by one of our middleware vendors). None of the development or test machines used by the developer had this service pack, but fortunately the publisher’s salespeople noticed the problem when they installed the game on their demo laptops. (when you’re relying on your publisher’s sales team for QA, you’re just asking for it!)</p><h2 id=\"less-is-more\">Less is More</h2><p>More than in most other software fields, game development is about efficient deployment of assets.</p><h3 id=\"think-small\">Think Small</h3><p>Game designers and artists often believe it’s easier to create more content than you need and pare it down as needed than to start small and add. This may be true in the “micro” sense but poses huge risks in the “macro” sense, particularly for console game development. One of the common “crunch time” factors in console games is the late attempt to get the game running in console memory. Usually this problem is hidden until an incovenient time by the fact that content developers usually develop on PC’s (and sometimes XBox’s) with high-performance graphics hardware and several times more memory than a console. And programmers, too, will develop on console devkits that feature more memory than the retail consoles.</p><p>Many designers and artists complain about the constraints of video game development, but I was gratified to encounter one exception. A junior game designer who was ordered to pare down his level commented to me that his level was actually improved by the streamlining — it forced him to make sure everything that he did retain was effectively used. Constraints are a good thing — they keep us from wandering all over the place trying out everything possible and instead focus on validating the cliche — quality over quantity.</p><h3 id=\"every-polygon-has-a-price\">Every Polygon Has a Price</h3><p>Each polygon, texture, and frame of animation should be justifiable. Serving as “eye candy” isn’t enough reason to put something in.</p><p>On one front end I spent quite a bit of time debugging some animated hieroglyphic textures, only to find out later that those icons had no connection to the game at all — they were just there for artistic, but meaningless, effect! HUD’s in particular tend to echo the worst of web design, ranging from the early blinking text to the modern Flash-filled pages. Games should be no exception to the principle that the interface should not get in the way — the best interfaces are interfaces that you don’t even notice.</p><h3 id=\"sound-advice\">Sound Advice</h3><p>What goes for graphics, goes for sound.</p><p>Laboring under the misconception that more options are better, one game developer president stated that our extreme sports game should allow ambient sounds and the soundtrack to be played concurrently. It turned out that loud rock songs easily obscured twittering birds in the background and hardly warranted the extra development complexity (the console had hardware support for just one stream). Another game had a list of sound effects for every element on the HUD, potentially resulting in a Las Vegas slot machine effect — the sound designer threw out most of them.</p><p>More is not necessarily better, and often it’s worse. Imagine all the sounds that could go off at once doing so, and scale it back if the result is cacaphony.</p><h3 id=\"dialogue\">Dialogue</h3><p>Same goes for dialog — every line should have a purpose. We don’t want voice-over (or text-over) dialog distracting from the interactive flow of the game, and each piece of dialog requires space, scripting, services of a voice actor (if voice-overs are used), rework if the dialog has to be rewritten or different voice actor is selected, and translations and re-recordings if the game is localized for different regions.</p><p>On one game project where I script-doctored the dialog, the publisher looked over the results briefly and asked for some crowd NPC dialog in one of the “cinematic” fight scenes. I added it just to keep them happy, but sure enough, once the level designers worked in the voice-overs, it was just a big muddle.</p><p>One practice I have used in writing game dialog is to include notes at the beginning of each section explaining what the dialogue is supposed to accomplish. Some of these objectives are the same as in any story, e.g. increasing empathy for the player character, establishing the badness of the bad guy. But dialogue can also highlight aspects of your game — if you hear the NPC’s talk about what they see or hear and how they coordinate amongs themselves, then you know the capabilities of the game AI.</p><p>Another thing to keep in mind is that scriptwriting for games is really more like scriptwriting for animated features rather than film. As with the former, you can’t rely on the range and subtlety of visual expression conveyed by human actors, so you must make sure it’s clear in the words.</p><h2 id=\"first-things-first\">First Things First</h2><p>As a general rule, anything that can be completed early in the project should be completed early. Get it out of the way, let it get tested thoroughly, and leave crunch time for the hard stuff, of which there will be plenty.</p><h3 id=\"front-end\">Front End</h3><p>The front end is typically an afterthought, fleshed out in the final months of a the game development, but it really should be one of the first things implemented. Even if the front-end requires some assets that will not be finalized for a while, placeholders can be substituted.</p><p>Completing a front end early provides a real functioning component of the game that can be demoed immediately and shows you’ve got more than just some storyboards and mockups with Flash.</p><p>Designing the front end early forces the game designers to complete the game design to that extent, so critical decisions like game modes (single-player, multiplayer, story, arcade, etc.), scores, game-save interface, are resolved early.</p><p>Implementing the front end early gives the developers (and anyone else who sees the game, including the publisher) a specific idea of what the game is about. A common complaint among developers on game projects is that they don’t understand what the game is supposed to be about — starting up the game in the same way as the eventual customers can alleviate that problem.</p><p>Implementing the front end early will expose design flaws, logical inconsistencies, and potential incompatibilies with the console makers’ requirements, e.g. memory card usage. Developers usually implement shortcuts that start up whatever level or feature they’re working on or testing, but then they get in the habit of relying on these shortcuts and the front end is not well-tested.</p><h3 id=\"media\">Media</h3><p>The final distribution on media may seem like the last thing to take care of, but again, it’s something that can and should be done early. Preparing the game assets for the target media is typically an elaborate process, and it’s best to get a handle on that before crunch time. And ideally, you want to test the game running on the media as soon as possible, so you’ll know if load times are acceptable, sound and FMV streaming works, and even if the game fits on disc. Many games now depend on “world” streaming, so it is crucial to verify that disc performance can keep up. Console development systems often provide disc emulators, but the performance characeristics often do not properly match those of the real hardware. I’ve seen games work perfectly on the emulator and then, a rude disappointment, fail when run from disc, sometimes just before a required milestone delivery.</p><h3 id=\"first-playable-last-shippable\">First Playable, Last Shippable</h3><p>Programmers complain the design is late and the designers complain they can’t finish the design until the programmers have the game up and running so they can tweak it. They’re both right. So while it’s probably not a bad idea to do as much in preproduction as you can, you can hedge your bets by working toward a “first playable”, consisting of at least one, but no more than three levels of the game.</p><p>This allows you to start off your project with a smaller team while you implement your core technologies and work out the basics of your game, and then you can staff up later to crank out the remaining levels.</p><p>The smaller target allows you to get to the playable point faster than if you tried to develop the full game at once. This allows you to reach a point much earlier at which you can evaluate the gameplay, asset budgets, target performance, and if the result is satisfactory, then you have a demo for the trade shows and game magazines.</p><p>If it turns out that the game is fundamentally flawed (or just not what the publisher wants), which is not uncommon, then you can change direction or even start over much more easily than if you had invested a full team and spent much longer in getting the game to a playable point.</p><p>Note the first playable is not the same as a prototype, which is basically a minimal demo that you shop around to get the deal. The first playable is really playable, which means it has all the user interface elements, game saves, functionality and polish that you would see in the final game.</p><h3 id=\"going-international\">Going International</h3><p>Localization is another typical afterthought. But as with everything else, get things ready early, so you won’t have to deal with it in the crunch.</p><h3 id=\"who%E2%80%99s-your-pal\">Who’s Your PAL?</h3><p>PAL resolution is slightly different from NTSC — in particular, the aspect ratio is slightly different, so you’ll want to verify that 2D elements in particular, such as the front end, text, HUD and movies, still look OK. The higher vertical resolution of PAL also can mean greater main or video memory usage.</p><p>I was astonished to find in one huge game project that none of the programmers had access to a PAL-capable PS2 devkit. They resorted to kludging in the code and then sending off a special build to QA for them to see if it really ran. The PAL frame rate is also different, so anything in your game dependent that assumes a certain frame period, e.g. movies or code executed per frame that doesn’t take in account real time elapsed, will behave differently.</p><h3 id=\"watch-your-language\">Watch Your Language</h3><p>I’ve seen more than one project where it was assumed that the publisher would deliver localized assets (text, audio) just once, and that the assets would be correct and final. That’s a pretty unrealistic assumption — publishers will express the importance of getting a game finished on time in no uncertain terms, but when it comes to deliverables from their in-hous departments, don’t expect them to respond with the same urgency.</p><p>At one developer working on a console title for the US and Europe, the president of the company assured me that the localized text from the publisher would be correct and final, so not to worry that the deliverable would happen just before the ship date. As it turned out, the holiday retail season came and went as we went through several iterations of the localized text, with 3–4 weeks between the updates. One of the near-final deliveries was incomplete because our producer contact took off for Christmas vacation without bothering to give us a complete set of corrected translations (and he didn’t mark which ones were changed — that was considerate!)</p><p>When you do actually receive translations, chances are they’re not going to be suitable.</p><p>The translation may be inappropriate for the desired context. For example, “button” could be translated differently depending on whether it belongs to a controller or piece of clothing. Or the translation may be just plain wrong. I’ve received translations that left me wondering if the publisher had just hired some beginning language students from the local college. In many cases, I’ve had to rely on European coworkers and the internet to find the right translations. Console makers typically require certain phrasing as part of their submission requirements. This can cause your submission to be returned several times until you get it right.</p><p>On one localization project, we went through several iterations of translations for the various mandatory disc and memory card error messages, until the console maker published a set of recommended translations for all of them. Upon which I gladly tossed out all of our publisher-provided translations.</p><p>Finally, translations may not fit in your existing on-screen buttons and other user interface elements, so you’ll either have to find shorter translations or rearrange your screen. You’ll probably need to load multiple new fonts, increasing your asset budget, and if you have a type-in screen, arrange to display all of those characters. All the more reason to set up your game for localization early and avoid rearranging a bunch of your screens later.</p><h2 id=\"it%E2%80%99s-software-development\">It’s Software Development</h2><p>Although game projects bear an increasing resemblance to Hollywood projects, game development is still fundamentally software development, yet despite being possibly the most challenging form of software development, the game industry lags behind other industries in software engineering and management practices.</p><h3 id=\"office-space\">Office Space</h3><p>It is conventional wisdom by now, supported by studies, that programmers are more productive (and less irritable, I might add) in their own offices. The elite technology companies like DEC used to make a point of getting programmers their own offices (if you were senior enough, you got a window).</p><p>One of my favorite employers, BBN, was one of these companies steeped in technology culture and provided individual offices for each of their engineers, until the fiscal pressues of the early eighties prompted them to move to cubicles and euphemisms (“come see our new open office environment!”).</p><p>The game industry, on the other hand, is the only software business I know of where people, including engineers, talk about cubicles and open “bullpens” as productivity-enhancing. This is a case where the appearance of activity and interaction doesn’t mean more productivity — more likely there’s an inverse relationship.</p><p>In one particularly abysmal game company, I was crammed into an office with two other programmers, with the finicky one sitting three feet from me complaining that my typing and mouse-clicking was too loud. (Apparently, he’d never heard of headphones) As a bonus, the men’s toilet on that floor was not designed to handle twenty male game developers and clogged up constantly (now I know why the British call it a “bog”) — combined with the lack of air conditioning, it made for swampy weekends.</p><p>Not the best environment for the regular workday, much less long work hours, which brings us to….</p><h3 id=\"avoid-the-crunch\">Avoid the Crunch</h3><p>Crunch time happens everywhere, but outside the game industry it’s recognized as a failure of management. In the game industry, however, even while paying lip service to the notion that crunch time is a bad thing, publishers and developers trot out the same trite spiel — it’s an unavoidable consequence of industry pressures, management has to tell developers to stop working and go home because they are motivated to work so much!</p><p>That’s quite a conceit. It’s one thing for someone to get on a roll and work through the night to get something cool done, it’s quite another for management to mandate 12-hour work days and weekend shifts for months at a time. It’s ultimately a self-defeating proposition.</p><p>Everyone has a natural pace and level of productivity. The reliable key people on your team will put in the extra hours, anyway. Everyone else will just hang around the office longer, web surf more, and just get on the nerves of those who are really working. In either case, they will resent the disruption of their personal lives due to mismanagement of the project schedule. And they won’t be completely wrong.</p><p>Contrary to popular belief, crunch time does not engender an increased level of production — you get more code and assets, but you get more mistakes due to rush jobs, weariness, and decreasing motivation. The risk-reward balance of crunch time is becoming more dangerous as game projects get bigger and more money is at stake, especially for console games that are unpatchable and the only recourse for flaws introduced at the last minute is to recall the product from the retail shelves.</p><h2 id=\"the-peanut-gallery\">The Peanut Gallery</h2><p>The cool thing about games is that everyone’s got an opinion. The bad thing about games is that everyone’s got an opinion. Playtesting provides critical validation of you game, but sorting the wheat from the chaff is required.</p><h3 id=\"focus-groups\">Focus Groups</h3><p>The problem with focus groups is a lack of. General comments often support the industry’s reputation for catering to adolescents — “Bigger boobs! More visual effects!” As with formulaic big-budget Hollywood movies, these elements may be reliable ingredients for drawing mainstream interest, but do you really need a survey to give you this information? Used in this manner, focus groups are just a pseudo-scientific way of reinforcing current preconceptions.</p><p>A game company president was peeved that most of the team showed little enthusiasm for making our game more risque, so the only comments she emphasized from a focus group test were the juvenile ones asking for more skin (the sole female tester demurred, but her opinions were not considered useful). However, the game was based on a family-friendly license and was supposed to achieve an “E” rating, so we spent a lot of time at the end of the project toning things back down.</p><p>But focus group results can be useful, if you really focus on “finding the fun”.</p><p>I was particularly impressed with one console maker’s rigorous in-house play-testing. Their testers would report initial impressions of the game, their impressions after one hour, then three hours, then eight hours. At each step, they gauged their level of empathy with the player character, their satisfaction with the visuals and audio, their frustration level if any with the difficulty level, and their motivation to continue.</p><h3 id=\"publishers-who-needs-them\">Publishers, Who Needs Them</h3><p>Unfortunately, you do. At least if you’re working on a console game. As in Hollywood, publishers think that because they make their money off games, they know how to make games. And since they make money off one in ten games, they know what consumers want. And then there’s reality.</p><p>Do not let a publisher design your game. If they were qualified to do that, they could develop the game themselves. Publishers should stick to their knitting — providing licensing, tools, testing, marketing, submission requirements, translations for localization, and most importantly, payment. Remarkably, I’ve seen publishers fail miserably in all these areas.</p><p>On one project I worked on, the publisher was late with the console development kits, borrowed more equipment from us for their other projects, paid late on almost every milestone, lost the license and then complained the game was too boring to sell (and it was fun with the license?), got briefly excited enough about the marketing campaign to order a case of custom-labelled Jones soda, and then lost interest and drank all the bottles.</p><p>A commonly-stated excuse is that publishers are “just trying to make money”. That in itself is enough reason for developers to make sure they protect their own interests, whether it’s making a great game or just surviving. But as with any other business, such a statement is overly simplistic — any publisher you deal with is a mix of people who are out for personal glory, personal wealth, job security, and some may be actually trying to make money for the company and some may actually be trying to make a great game.</p><p>I heard one publisher complain that they helped unknown developers get their start only to be left behind when those developers ended up on well-known franchines. Yet this publisher had a history of imposing tight schedules and low budgets on these hungry developers, and they would sell the resulting titles to other publishers at the first opportunity to make a quick profit.</p><p>The most successful game companies control their own fate as much as possible. The most successful game I’ve worked on relied almost entirely on in-house resources. An impressive marketing effort, including a fan site, magazine interviews, developer blogs, and even a comic book. The in-house QA group was knowledgable about console submission requirements.</p><h3 id=\"don%E2%80%99t-be-evil\">Don’t Be Evil</h3><p>Publishers aren’t just often bad at their business — they are notoriously bad about business. In just the past few years I’ve heard of publishers going on group outings to strip clubs, granting projects to developers in return for trips to strip clubs (sense a theme here?), producers propositioning female developers, and even rumor of a publisher bribed with a new Porsche to get a project. Aside from the sleazy, there’s the adversarial. I’ve heard that a publisher lawyer at a game development conference stated the best negotiated deal for a publisher is one that bankrupts the developer. With this attitude, it’s no wonder taht a favorite publisher trick to enforce crunch time is to send a producer to camp out at a developer’s office and make sure they’re working into the evenings), And not only have I seen publishers make lame excuses (or no excuse) for late payment and non-payment to developers, I’ve encountered those tactics in my own contracts with them — contracts rewritten without informing me, micromanagement in order to penny-pinch (“spend ten minutes on this, fifteen minutes on that…”), and weasely attempts to get free work (“Oh, we thought you could just take a look at it…”)</p><p>But as easy as it is to blame industry woes on publishers, developers who engage in the same practices have my utter lack of sympathy.</p><p>The one time I heard management say they were opposed to mandatory crunch time work schedules, they shortly announced six months of required weekend work for the entire staff. And I’ve seen the same gamut of bad-client practices from developers, ranging from renegotiation of ongoing contracts (one client had a practice of this with her contractors, even telling me at the end of a contract “when I have time, I’ll let you know what I think is reasonable”), to blatant non-payment (on a project that was dragging on, the client said they had no expectation of paying me for the extra time, yet sued their publisher for the same thing), to sneaking in as much as possible into a contract (I started out at one developer with four weekly paid milestones which turned into two payments for four milestones which turned into one payment for four completely unspecified milestones and an unpaid “transitional period” of work.)</p><p>At times it seems developers and publishers are engaged in an unholy alliance.</p><p>I’ve heard of developers expressing their “appreciation” to publishers with tokens ranging from gift certificates, birthday gifts, hotel accomodations, strip club outings, and even rumors of a car given to a producer in order to seal a development deal. I saw one breach-of-contract lawsuit filed by a developer against a publisher settled by not only payment of cash to the developer, but also a hefty pile of stock and a “consulting” agreement granted to the developer’s president. It’s not uncommon to see the owners of a game developer shutter the company, leaving the employees unpaid, only to start up a new venture. Who suffers? The rank and file.</p><p>I’m the last one to defend publishers, but sometimes you guys deserve each other. Don’t be part of the problem.</p>","comment_id":"60770b5af846bc003eaad4e6","plaintext":"Note(This essay is somewhat dated, as you can see by the section on NTSC/PAL)> \nOnce you can remove no more, you are done. — Japanese saying\nGetting Started\nMy first piece of advice to anyone contemplating a game development project —\ndon’t. (Well, at least not until you know what you’re getting into.) But if you\ngo ahead, anyway, here are some tips beginning with staffing:\n\nDispassionate Gamers\nGame job postings typically list “a passion for gaming” as a prerequisite (along\nwith its partner, “willing to put in extra hours”). Other industries don’t do\nthis — you don’t see ads requiring “a passion for factory automation software”\nor “a passion for working on banking systems”. Anyway, a devotion to games\ndoesn’t necessarily translate to productivity and work ethic.\n\nMost of the game developers I’ve worked with were avid gamers but many,\nincluding one of the best gamers I’ve ever met, didn’t apply the same\nconcentration and motivation to their work. I’ve seen plenty of work with\nobvious defects, even an FMV with a two-second blank gap, either due to\ninattention or laziness (one artist even told me his video package could not\nreexport his FMV in AVI format, until I stated that was the only format I could\nprocess for our target console — then he promptly reexported it).\n\nI’ll take professionalism over passion any day. If you need to hire janitorial\nstaff, you’re not going to look for some crazy nut who has a passion for toilets\n— you want responsible people who take pride in doing their job.\n\nMost of the best game artists I’ve worked with were only moderately interested\nin gaming — they were artists first and their results far surpassed those of\nmediocre artists with high gaming skills. They were conscientious enough to\nplay-test their work during development but once the games were released,\ntypically never touched them again.\n\nNow, game design is one area where presumably an absorption in games would be\nreally useful. But even there, you’ll find the best game designers are who have\nthe intellectual breadth and analytical ability to figure out what makes a game\nfun and to move beyond knockoffs of existing games.\n\nA common entry route to game development is via QA groups, and I think that is a\ngood one — testing is a good introduction to the game development process\nwithout getting in the critical path, and anyone who can’t develop the patience\nand analytical abilities for that role is probably going to do a worse job in a\nproduction position.\n\nTo put a final point on this, if a passion for gaming is so important for game\ndevelopment, why are so many non-gamers in high-level decision-making positions\non game projects? Many, if not most, of the high-level producers I’ve met are\nmediocre gamers at best, and it gets worse as you go up the corporate ladder.\n\nI know of one game prototype that had all kinds of pizzazz thrown in at the\nproducer’s request, and then the whole thing had to be scaled down at the last\nminute so the demo wouldn’t confuse the executives who had final approval. (Of\ncourse, the producers should have known this)\n\nProgrammers are from Mars, Artists are from Venus\nThe production pipeline is always the bottleneck, so you need people who not\nonly work well, but work well in the context of a production.\n\nEven some experienced and talented game artists do not work well in game\ndevelopment teams. Just throwing assets over the wall and assuming the\nprogrammers will fix it wastes time and engenders hostility from the programming\nteam. The more difficult artists I’ve met were stubborn to the point of\nbelligerence and considered the rest of the game team as staff supporting (or\nlimiting) their artistic accomplishments.\n\nSome phrases that have lost their novelty — “I didn’t change anything”, “It’s\nbroken — fix it!”, “That’s how it works in 3D Studio Max”.\n\nAnd while programmers often grouse with justification that artists aren’t\nfeeding suitable data into the production pipeline, it is incumbent upon them to\nprovide the proper guidance, in the form of clear documentation and explanation.\n\nProgrammers often don’t like to commit to numbers early, but artists and game\ndesigners need reliable asset budgets to do their job within the proper\nconstraints, just as programmers need to know the hardware and delivery\nconstraints. If artists and designers actually ask for budgets and guidance on\nhow to optimize assets, then by all means accomodate them.\n\nThe Producers\nProducers can be useful, if they’re not puffed up by the term “producer”.\nThey’re the only the part of the production pipeline that doesn’t actually\nproduce anything (except those producers who produce funding — they get to be\ncalled “executive producers”). A better term would be “facilitator”.\n\nIn the worst case, a producer will just cause more work for everyone else. The\nlast thing a game project needs is a high-maintenance producer.\n\nI was once plagued by a throng of producers who would hold daily status\nmeetings, carry around lists of tasks and ask everyone to update the number of\nhours remaining per task on the lists (none of which matched), and stroll around\nasking, “So…what are you working on?” After may of the producers were laid off\ndue to tightened funding, the project ran more smoothly.\n\nBut a knowledgable producer who is focused on keeping things running smoothly is\nindispensable.\n\nI was vastly relieved that a survivor of the aforementioned layoff was an\nassistant producer who did a fantastic job of keeping on top of things. Every\ntime I needed clarification on a game feature, he had the answer, knew where to\nget it, or could make a reasonable call on the spot. In any case, I had an\nanswer within minutes. And he was the guy who ordered all the late-night meals.\n\nAt least producers in development shops have an idea what it actually takes to\nmake a game. Producers who’ve only worked for publishers are less knowledgable\nand more self-important.\n\nOne stupid publisher trick: planting a producer at a developer’s office during\ncrunch time to make sure they’re all working late into the night. When I showed\none of these producers, who was camped out in my office during one of these\ncrunches, the set of game design, production and business books on my shelf, he\ncommented his boss had recommended he read some of them. And then he kicked me\nout of my office so he could have it to himself.\n\nThink Inside the Box\n“Think outside the box” is an oft-misused mantra. Questioning your underlying\nassumptions brings about innovation. Just making stuff up is a waste of time.\n\nIn high school, I joined other students who wanted to pad their college\napplications by competing in a statewide brainstorming competition, where we\nattempted to outdo each other in constructing the most fantastic scenarios\npossible. Odds favored those who most lost touch with reality.\n\nWhat separates game artists and programmers from their brethren in other fields\nis the ability to create for resource-constrained platforms.\n\nScreen Size\nTake into account the screen size. For PC games, you have to decide how many\nstandard PC monitor resolutions, refresh rates, color depths, and full-screen\nvs. windowed modes you’re going to support, and be sure to test the game with\nthose settings. Even with console games, you may have more than one setting to\nworry about. If your game will be in both the US and Europe, then you need to\nhandle both NTSC and PAL, which have different screen resolutions, with\ncorresponding aspect ratios and memory requirements, and different refresh\nrates, which may affect any game behavior dependent on per-frame computation.\nAnd there are other modes like EURGB60, M-PAL, 480p (progressive scan) and\nmultiple levels of HDTV.\n\nPreprocess Everything\nData created by game artists and designers eventually gets converted into\nformats usable on the target platforms. PC game engines often defer this\nconversion until runtime for convenience, but for consoles, where memory is\ncomparatively limited, loading from disc is slower, and the main CPU may be\nrelatively underpowered, it is important to have as much data preparation and\noptimization done offline as possible. Even for PC games, while developers may\nbe lulled by the latest and greatest in PC hardware, there is still a customer\nbase with configurations a few years old, and if they were budget PC’s then,\nimagine how limited they are now.\n\nGet Lots of Hardware\nGame development schedules are always tight, and even expensive hardware is\ncheap compared to personnel cost and the cost of missing a milestone and having\nyour project cancelled, or missing the holiday retail season and losing out on\nthose sales. Cutting-edge hardware, especially console development kits, is\nnotoriously fragile, so you want to have extra units on hand if and when the\nhardware fails.\n\nAlmost every time I’ve worked on a console game, the game development hardware\nmalfunctioned at some point and had to be sent back to the console maker for\nrepair. In each case, the turnaround time was no more than two weeks, but two\nweeks on a crunch time project with monthly milestone deliverables is crucial.\nFortunately, the developers always had on hand an extra kit that could be\nrepurposed from less critical tasks.\n\nAnother reason to have redundant development hardware is to identify bugs that\nare due to glitchy hardware versus those present in your game.\n\nNear the end of one console project, I ran into crashes of our game that\noccurred after several hours of the game running idle. Since we had multiple\ntest kits, I could run several soak tests in parallel and isolate the crashes to\none unit, and thereby conclude that it was a test hardware problem (and it was\nverified later that some units were known to have overheating issues)\n\nConsole games have the advantage that you only need to verify proper operation\non a very limited set of configurations. For PC games you should have a variety\nof different hardware, operating systems, and various configurations for testing\nyour game. This is true for cell phone games, too — phone models vary in screen\nsize and color resolution, refresh rate, memory, etc.\n\nI nearly missed one Windows compatibility issue with a PC game after Microsoft\nintroduced a service pack that removed support for a video codec that we used\nfor an FMV (in fact, the codec was used by one of our middleware vendors). None\nof the development or test machines used by the developer had this service pack,\nbut fortunately the publisher’s salespeople noticed the problem when they\ninstalled the game on their demo laptops. (when you’re relying on your\npublisher’s sales team for QA, you’re just asking for it!)\n\nLess is More\nMore than in most other software fields, game development is about efficient\ndeployment of assets.\n\nThink Small\nGame designers and artists often believe it’s easier to create more content than\nyou need and pare it down as needed than to start small and add. This may be\ntrue in the “micro” sense but poses huge risks in the “macro” sense,\nparticularly for console game development. One of the common “crunch time”\nfactors in console games is the late attempt to get the game running in console\nmemory. Usually this problem is hidden until an incovenient time by the fact\nthat content developers usually develop on PC’s (and sometimes XBox’s) with\nhigh-performance graphics hardware and several times more memory than a console.\nAnd programmers, too, will develop on console devkits that feature more memory\nthan the retail consoles.\n\nMany designers and artists complain about the constraints of video game\ndevelopment, but I was gratified to encounter one exception. A junior game\ndesigner who was ordered to pare down his level commented to me that his level\nwas actually improved by the streamlining — it forced him to make sure\neverything that he did retain was effectively used. Constraints are a good thing\n— they keep us from wandering all over the place trying out everything possible\nand instead focus on validating the cliche — quality over quantity.\n\nEvery Polygon Has a Price\nEach polygon, texture, and frame of animation should be justifiable. Serving as\n“eye candy” isn’t enough reason to put something in.\n\nOn one front end I spent quite a bit of time debugging some animated\nhieroglyphic textures, only to find out later that those icons had no connection\nto the game at all — they were just there for artistic, but meaningless, effect!\nHUD’s in particular tend to echo the worst of web design, ranging from the early\nblinking text to the modern Flash-filled pages. Games should be no exception to\nthe principle that the interface should not get in the way — the best interfaces\nare interfaces that you don’t even notice.\n\nSound Advice\nWhat goes for graphics, goes for sound.\n\nLaboring under the misconception that more options are better, one game\ndeveloper president stated that our extreme sports game should allow ambient\nsounds and the soundtrack to be played concurrently. It turned out that loud\nrock songs easily obscured twittering birds in the background and hardly\nwarranted the extra development complexity (the console had hardware support for\njust one stream). Another game had a list of sound effects for every element on\nthe HUD, potentially resulting in a Las Vegas slot machine effect — the sound\ndesigner threw out most of them.\n\nMore is not necessarily better, and often it’s worse. Imagine all the sounds\nthat could go off at once doing so, and scale it back if the result is\ncacaphony.\n\nDialogue\nSame goes for dialog — every line should have a purpose. We don’t want\nvoice-over (or text-over) dialog distracting from the interactive flow of the\ngame, and each piece of dialog requires space, scripting, services of a voice\nactor (if voice-overs are used), rework if the dialog has to be rewritten or\ndifferent voice actor is selected, and translations and re-recordings if the\ngame is localized for different regions.\n\nOn one game project where I script-doctored the dialog, the publisher looked\nover the results briefly and asked for some crowd NPC dialog in one of the\n“cinematic” fight scenes. I added it just to keep them happy, but sure enough,\nonce the level designers worked in the voice-overs, it was just a big muddle.\n\nOne practice I have used in writing game dialog is to include notes at the\nbeginning of each section explaining what the dialogue is supposed to\naccomplish. Some of these objectives are the same as in any story, e.g.\nincreasing empathy for the player character, establishing the badness of the bad\nguy. But dialogue can also highlight aspects of your game — if you hear the\nNPC’s talk about what they see or hear and how they coordinate amongs\nthemselves, then you know the capabilities of the game AI.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that scriptwriting for games is really more\nlike scriptwriting for animated features rather than film. As with the former,\nyou can’t rely on the range and subtlety of visual expression conveyed by human\nactors, so you must make sure it’s clear in the words.\n\nFirst Things First\nAs a general rule, anything that can be completed early in the project should be\ncompleted early. Get it out of the way, let it get tested thoroughly, and leave\ncrunch time for the hard stuff, of which there will be plenty.\n\nFront End\nThe front end is typically an afterthought, fleshed out in the final months of a\nthe game development, but it really should be one of the first things\nimplemented. Even if the front-end requires some assets that will not be\nfinalized for a while, placeholders can be substituted.\n\nCompleting a front end early provides a real functioning component of the game\nthat can be demoed immediately and shows you’ve got more than just some\nstoryboards and mockups with Flash.\n\nDesigning the front end early forces the game designers to complete the game\ndesign to that extent, so critical decisions like game modes (single-player,\nmultiplayer, story, arcade, etc.), scores, game-save interface, are resolved\nearly.\n\nImplementing the front end early gives the developers (and anyone else who sees\nthe game, including the publisher) a specific idea of what the game is about. A\ncommon complaint among developers on game projects is that they don’t understand\nwhat the game is supposed to be about — starting up the game in the same way as\nthe eventual customers can alleviate that problem.\n\nImplementing the front end early will expose design flaws, logical\ninconsistencies, and potential incompatibilies with the console makers’\nrequirements, e.g. memory card usage. Developers usually implement shortcuts\nthat start up whatever level or feature they’re working on or testing, but then\nthey get in the habit of relying on these shortcuts and the front end is not\nwell-tested.\n\nMedia\nThe final distribution on media may seem like the last thing to take care of,\nbut again, it’s something that can and should be done early. Preparing the game\nassets for the target media is typically an elaborate process, and it’s best to\nget a handle on that before crunch time. And ideally, you want to test the game\nrunning on the media as soon as possible, so you’ll know if load times are\nacceptable, sound and FMV streaming works, and even if the game fits on disc.\nMany games now depend on “world” streaming, so it is crucial to verify that disc\nperformance can keep up. Console development systems often provide disc\nemulators, but the performance characeristics often do not properly match those\nof the real hardware. I’ve seen games work perfectly on the emulator and then, a\nrude disappointment, fail when run from disc, sometimes just before a required\nmilestone delivery.\n\nFirst Playable, Last Shippable\nProgrammers complain the design is late and the designers complain they can’t\nfinish the design until the programmers have the game up and running so they can\ntweak it. They’re both right. So while it’s probably not a bad idea to do as\nmuch in preproduction as you can, you can hedge your bets by working toward a\n“first playable”, consisting of at least one, but no more than three levels of\nthe game.\n\nThis allows you to start off your project with a smaller team while you\nimplement your core technologies and work out the basics of your game, and then\nyou can staff up later to crank out the remaining levels.\n\nThe smaller target allows you to get to the playable point faster than if you\ntried to develop the full game at once. This allows you to reach a point much\nearlier at which you can evaluate the gameplay, asset budgets, target\nperformance, and if the result is satisfactory, then you have a demo for the\ntrade shows and game magazines.\n\nIf it turns out that the game is fundamentally flawed (or just not what the\npublisher wants), which is not uncommon, then you can change direction or even\nstart over much more easily than if you had invested a full team and spent much\nlonger in getting the game to a playable point.\n\nNote the first playable is not the same as a prototype, which is basically a\nminimal demo that you shop around to get the deal. The first playable is really\nplayable, which means it has all the user interface elements, game saves,\nfunctionality and polish that you would see in the final game.\n\nGoing International\nLocalization is another typical afterthought. But as with everything else, get\nthings ready early, so you won’t have to deal with it in the crunch.\n\nWho’s Your PAL?\nPAL resolution is slightly different from NTSC — in particular, the aspect ratio\nis slightly different, so you’ll want to verify that 2D elements in particular,\nsuch as the front end, text, HUD and movies, still look OK. The higher vertical\nresolution of PAL also can mean greater main or video memory usage.\n\nI was astonished to find in one huge game project that none of the programmers\nhad access to a PAL-capable PS2 devkit. They resorted to kludging in the code\nand then sending off a special build to QA for them to see if it really ran. The\nPAL frame rate is also different, so anything in your game dependent that\nassumes a certain frame period, e.g. movies or code executed per frame that\ndoesn’t take in account real time elapsed, will behave differently.\n\nWatch Your Language\nI’ve seen more than one project where it was assumed that the publisher would\ndeliver localized assets (text, audio) just once, and that the assets would be\ncorrect and final. That’s a pretty unrealistic assumption — publishers will\nexpress the importance of getting a game finished on time in no uncertain terms,\nbut when it comes to deliverables from their in-hous departments, don’t expect\nthem to respond with the same urgency.\n\nAt one developer working on a console title for the US and Europe, the president\nof the company assured me that the localized text from the publisher would be\ncorrect and final, so not to worry that the deliverable would happen just before\nthe ship date. As it turned out, the holiday retail season came and went as we\nwent through several iterations of the localized text, with 3–4 weeks between\nthe updates. One of the near-final deliveries was incomplete because our\nproducer contact took off for Christmas vacation without bothering to give us a\ncomplete set of corrected translations (and he didn’t mark which ones were\nchanged — that was considerate!)\n\nWhen you do actually receive translations, chances are they’re not going to be\nsuitable.\n\nThe translation may be inappropriate for the desired context. For example,\n“button” could be translated differently depending on whether it belongs to a\ncontroller or piece of clothing. Or the translation may be just plain wrong.\nI’ve received translations that left me wondering if the publisher had just\nhired some beginning language students from the local college. In many cases,\nI’ve had to rely on European coworkers and the internet to find the right\ntranslations. Console makers typically require certain phrasing as part of their\nsubmission requirements. This can cause your submission to be returned several\ntimes until you get it right.\n\nOn one localization project, we went through several iterations of translations\nfor the various mandatory disc and memory card error messages, until the console\nmaker published a set of recommended translations for all of them. Upon which I\ngladly tossed out all of our publisher-provided translations.\n\nFinally, translations may not fit in your existing on-screen buttons and other\nuser interface elements, so you’ll either have to find shorter translations or\nrearrange your screen. You’ll probably need to load multiple new fonts,\nincreasing your asset budget, and if you have a type-in screen, arrange to\ndisplay all of those characters. All the more reason to set up your game for\nlocalization early and avoid rearranging a bunch of your screens later.\n\nIt’s Software Development\nAlthough game projects bear an increasing resemblance to Hollywood projects,\ngame development is still fundamentally software development, yet despite being\npossibly the most challenging form of software development, the game industry\nlags behind other industries in software engineering and management practices.\n\nOffice Space\nIt is conventional wisdom by now, supported by studies, that programmers are\nmore productive (and less irritable, I might add) in their own offices. The\nelite technology companies like DEC used to make a point of getting programmers\ntheir own offices (if you were senior enough, you got a window).\n\nOne of my favorite employers, BBN, was one of these companies steeped in\ntechnology culture and provided individual offices for each of their engineers,\nuntil the fiscal pressues of the early eighties prompted them to move to\ncubicles and euphemisms (“come see our new open office environment!”).\n\nThe game industry, on the other hand, is the only software business I know of\nwhere people, including engineers, talk about cubicles and open “bullpens” as\nproductivity-enhancing. This is a case where the appearance of activity and\ninteraction doesn’t mean more productivity — more likely there’s an inverse\nrelationship.\n\nIn one particularly abysmal game company, I was crammed into an office with two\nother programmers, with the finicky one sitting three feet from me complaining\nthat my typing and mouse-clicking was too loud. (Apparently, he’d never heard of\nheadphones) As a bonus, the men’s toilet on that floor was not designed to\nhandle twenty male game developers and clogged up constantly (now I know why the\nBritish call it a “bog”) — combined with the lack of air conditioning, it made\nfor swampy weekends.\n\nNot the best environment for the regular workday, much less long work hours,\nwhich brings us to….\n\nAvoid the Crunch\nCrunch time happens everywhere, but outside the game industry it’s recognized as\na failure of management. In the game industry, however, even while paying lip\nservice to the notion that crunch time is a bad thing, publishers and developers\ntrot out the same trite spiel — it’s an unavoidable consequence of industry\npressures, management has to tell developers to stop working and go home because\nthey are motivated to work so much!\n\nThat’s quite a conceit. It’s one thing for someone to get on a roll and work\nthrough the night to get something cool done, it’s quite another for management\nto mandate 12-hour work days and weekend shifts for months at a time. It’s\nultimately a self-defeating proposition.\n\nEveryone has a natural pace and level of productivity. The reliable key people\non your team will put in the extra hours, anyway. Everyone else will just hang\naround the office longer, web surf more, and just get on the nerves of those who\nare really working. In either case, they will resent the disruption of their\npersonal lives due to mismanagement of the project schedule. And they won’t be\ncompletely wrong.\n\nContrary to popular belief, crunch time does not engender an increased level of\nproduction — you get more code and assets, but you get more mistakes due to rush\njobs, weariness, and decreasing motivation. The risk-reward balance of crunch\ntime is becoming more dangerous as game projects get bigger and more money is at\nstake, especially for console games that are unpatchable and the only recourse\nfor flaws introduced at the last minute is to recall the product from the retail\nshelves.\n\nThe Peanut Gallery\nThe cool thing about games is that everyone’s got an opinion. The bad thing\nabout games is that everyone’s got an opinion. Playtesting provides critical\nvalidation of you game, but sorting the wheat from the chaff is required.\n\nFocus Groups\nThe problem with focus groups is a lack of. General comments often support the\nindustry’s reputation for catering to adolescents — “Bigger boobs! More visual\neffects!” As with formulaic big-budget Hollywood movies, these elements may be\nreliable ingredients for drawing mainstream interest, but do you really need a\nsurvey to give you this information? Used in this manner, focus groups are just\na pseudo-scientific way of reinforcing current preconceptions.\n\nA game company president was peeved that most of the team showed little\nenthusiasm for making our game more risque, so the only comments she emphasized\nfrom a focus group test were the juvenile ones asking for more skin (the sole\nfemale tester demurred, but her opinions were not considered useful). However,\nthe game was based on a family-friendly license and was supposed to achieve an\n“E” rating, so we spent a lot of time at the end of the project toning things\nback down.\n\nBut focus group results can be useful, if you really focus on “finding the fun”.\n\nI was particularly impressed with one console maker’s rigorous in-house\nplay-testing. Their testers would report initial impressions of the game, their\nimpressions after one hour, then three hours, then eight hours. At each step,\nthey gauged their level of empathy with the player character, their satisfaction\nwith the visuals and audio, their frustration level if any with the difficulty\nlevel, and their motivation to continue.\n\nPublishers, Who Needs Them\nUnfortunately, you do. At least if you’re working on a console game. As in\nHollywood, publishers think that because they make their money off games, they\nknow how to make games. And since they make money off one in ten games, they\nknow what consumers want. And then there’s reality.\n\nDo not let a publisher design your game. If they were qualified to do that, they\ncould develop the game themselves. Publishers should stick to their knitting —\nproviding licensing, tools, testing, marketing, submission requirements,\ntranslations for localization, and most importantly, payment. Remarkably, I’ve\nseen publishers fail miserably in all these areas.\n\nOn one project I worked on, the publisher was late with the console development\nkits, borrowed more equipment from us for their other projects, paid late on\nalmost every milestone, lost the license and then complained the game was too\nboring to sell (and it was fun with the license?), got briefly excited enough\nabout the marketing campaign to order a case of custom-labelled Jones soda, and\nthen lost interest and drank all the bottles.\n\nA commonly-stated excuse is that publishers are “just trying to make money”.\nThat in itself is enough reason for developers to make sure they protect their\nown interests, whether it’s making a great game or just surviving. But as with\nany other business, such a statement is overly simplistic — any publisher you\ndeal with is a mix of people who are out for personal glory, personal wealth,\njob security, and some may be actually trying to make money for the company and\nsome may actually be trying to make a great game.\n\nI heard one publisher complain that they helped unknown developers get their\nstart only to be left behind when those developers ended up on well-known\nfranchines. Yet this publisher had a history of imposing tight schedules and low\nbudgets on these hungry developers, and they would sell the resulting titles to\nother publishers at the first opportunity to make a quick profit.\n\nThe most successful game companies control their own fate as much as possible.\nThe most successful game I’ve worked on relied almost entirely on in-house\nresources. An impressive marketing effort, including a fan site, magazine\ninterviews, developer blogs, and even a comic book. The in-house QA group was\nknowledgable about console submission requirements.\n\nDon’t Be Evil\nPublishers aren’t just often bad at their business — they are notoriously bad\nabout business. In just the past few years I’ve heard of publishers going on\ngroup outings to strip clubs, granting projects to developers in return for\ntrips to strip clubs (sense a theme here?), producers propositioning female\ndevelopers, and even rumor of a publisher bribed with a new Porsche to get a\nproject. Aside from the sleazy, there’s the adversarial. I’ve heard that a\npublisher lawyer at a game development conference stated the best negotiated\ndeal for a publisher is one that bankrupts the developer. With this attitude,\nit’s no wonder taht a favorite publisher trick to enforce crunch time is to send\na producer to camp out at a developer’s office and make sure they’re working\ninto the evenings), And not only have I seen publishers make lame excuses (or no\nexcuse) for late payment and non-payment to developers, I’ve encountered those\ntactics in my own contracts with them — contracts rewritten without informing\nme, micromanagement in order to penny-pinch (“spend ten minutes on this, fifteen\nminutes on that…”), and weasely attempts to get free work (“Oh, we thought you\ncould just take a look at it…”)\n\nBut as easy as it is to blame industry woes on publishers, developers who engage\nin the same practices have my utter lack of sympathy.\n\nThe one time I heard management say they were opposed to mandatory crunch time\nwork schedules, they shortly announced six months of required weekend work for\nthe entire staff. And I’ve seen the same gamut of bad-client practices from\ndevelopers, ranging from renegotiation of ongoing contracts (one client had a\npractice of this with her contractors, even telling me at the end of a contract\n“when I have time, I’ll let you know what I think is reasonable”), to blatant\nnon-payment (on a project that was dragging on, the client said they had no\nexpectation of paying me for the extra time, yet sued their publisher for the\nsame thing), to sneaking in as much as possible into a contract (I started out\nat one developer with four weekly paid milestones which turned into two payments\nfor four milestones which turned into one payment for four completely\nunspecified milestones and an unpaid “transitional period” of work.)\n\nAt times it seems developers and publishers are engaged in an unholy alliance.\n\nI’ve heard of developers expressing their “appreciation” to publishers with\ntokens ranging from gift certificates, birthday gifts, hotel accomodations,\nstrip club outings, and even rumors of a car given to a producer in order to\nseal a development deal. I saw one breach-of-contract lawsuit filed by a\ndeveloper against a publisher settled by not only payment of cash to the\ndeveloper, but also a hefty pile of stock and a “consulting” agreement granted\nto the developer’s president. It’s not uncommon to see the owners of a game\ndeveloper shutter the company, leaving the employees unpaid, only to start up a\nnew venture. Who suffers? The rank and file.\n\nI’m the last one to defend publishers, but sometimes you guys deserve each\nother. Don’t be part of the problem.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"status:free","created_at":"2021-04-14T15:33:46.000Z","updated_at":"2021-04-14T15:37:54.000Z","published_at":"2021-04-14T15:37:54.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":"6270d8fd981c6c00315c2cee"},{"id":"60771182f846bc003eaad4f5","uuid":"31a15a4e-aabb-425e-a7d2-e16ea06db817","title":"May You Live In Interesting Times","slug":"untitled-36","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"That ancient Chinese curse, “May you live in interesting times,” seems increasingly appropriate these days.

Of course, there are\ndifferences, and fashions change, but there’s a surprising amount of uniformity.\n\nTake tabs. A typical social-featured iOS app has five tabs on the bottom, which\nyou would expect if you read the iOS Human Interface Guidelines and saw that\nUITabBar displays a maximum of five icons. But it’s interesting to see what\nthose icons are: almost all social apps (on my device, Facebook, twitter,\ntumblr, instagram, flicker, artstation, artstack, pinterest, ello, medium…) have\nthe content stream in the leftmost tab, notifications in the second to leftmost\nor second to rightmost tab (sometimes called activity, e.g. tumblr, and some\napps like Pinterest just avoid the whole naming issue by having no tab names —\nbut what do they call them in internal meetings, “that watchamacallit in the\nsecond tab?”), account info in the rightmost tab, and the middle is often the\ncreation screen, e.g. the camera in instagram or write in medium.\n\nThose last two examples are also kind of weird in that they override the middle\ntab button so it brings up a modal screen. Facebook is further bizarre in\nplacing a Messenger button there, which brings you out of the app into the\nMessenger app, but it’s sort of the same idea in placing the function you want\nto promote in the center button, as opposed to placing what you want to first\nsee in the leftmost button.\n\nAlso, have you noticed user avatar icons in iOS apps are almost always round?\nAgain, if you’re familiar with the underlying implementation, it’s pretty easy\nto render round images (by tweaking UIImageViews layers), probably easier than\ndoing on web pages, so this may be why older apps like twitter and Facebook\nstill have square icons (with rounded corners, so never mind that harder on the\nweb theory), but it’s interesting to see Facebook’s Messenger and Pages use\nround icons.\n\nAs for search, it seems they all use a UISearchbar at top, sometimes with an\neverpresent bar over the feed (Facebook) or, probably more often, a search icon\n(spyglass) that brings up said search bar.\n\nAs for likes, seems like everyone’s going with hearts instead of stars, with\ntwitter a notable convert, though Facebook still has thumbs. Hearts tend to be\nred when voted (pinterest), though medium has a weird green color, which matches\ntheir other tint colors, but…green?\n\nFor comments, I think I see a trend toward chat-bubble displays, with pinterest\nadding them. Maybe an attempt to make everything look more like messaging apps,\nbut it does look more interesting.\n\nThere are some apps that do all this very differently, like Giphy.

We had to\nwrite two stories – I spent the entire semester writing this one (so this is\nprobably a distilled version, but perhaps better for it) and had to write the\nsecond in one night, so the latter was probably garbage. The first one got a\nnice comment from the instructor and mixed reviews from my classmates. A male\nstudent commented that the characters were ridiculously unbelievable. But a\nfemale student approached me after my reading and said \"I know someone just like\nthat!\"\n\nI met her on the beach. Even now, when I see sand, I think of her. We walked and\nheld hands and occasionally kissed, but mostly she liked to hug. Her kisses\ntasted sweet but she hugged like a boa constrictor.\n\nShe didn't seem that interested in getting beyond the kisses and the\nbone-crushing hugs. One time at her apartment it looked like we were getting\nsomewhere, but the building fire alarm went off, so we got dressed and went to\nher favorite restaurant, a neighborhood Chinese place that catered to the\ncollege crowd.

They trot out that boilerplate every time someone argues with\ntheir app rejections (just with most of us small fry, it doesn't make the\nheadlines).\n\nFor some reason, most of the media and customers unquestioningly buy that line,\napparently forgetting this is a corporation. Remember, they have an army of\nreviewers, probably not experts in anything in particular (one reviewer rejected\nmy app for a trademark infringement, and I said, you mean copyright? and the\nresponse was, yeah, that, though it was neither), and agendas both obvious (that\n30% cut of in-app purchases) and unstated.\n\nLike when they rejected a bunch of my app updates around the time of their\ndisastrous Maps launch, citing the conveniently widely interpretable app\napproval guidelines section on having enough functionality. But they gave me the\noption of resubmitting with additional native iOS functionality integrated,\n\"such as Maps.\" And this, by the way, is why Talk Dim Sum\n[http://talkdimsum.com./] has a map feature. I was just trying to play it safe.\n\nThis is a typical sequence in their \"Resolution Center\" (it's the App Store\nequivalent of getting called to the principal's office). It accomplishes the hat\ntrick of condescension, vagueness, and bureacracy.\n\nWhen it gets to that point, I know it's over. There will be a phone call from an\nApple rep relaying a message so insubstantive or ridiculous it can't be put into\nwriting, like \"Sorry, we can't approve it,\" or \"We don't know what to say except\nstart over from scratch.\"\n\nI guess if I'd invested a lot of time and money specifically in getting \nHyperBowl [http://hyperbowl.rocks/] launched on Apple TV, I would have felt\nobligated to knuckle under and display obeisance. Because another aspect of\ncorporations is they will never admit they were wrong, which is why whenever you\nsee Apple publicly reverse a rejection, it's after the developer \"made the\nnecessary changes.\" \n\nWell, granted, I've experienced a couple of exceptions. I had one rejection for\nnot having an app description, and I said yes there is, and they said, oops,\nsorry. And another time I got the dreaded phone call, but after rejecting my\nassertion that my selling HyperBowl lanes individually was not charging\ncustomers to level up, they said \"We'll let it go this time.\" So magnanimous.\n\nI still like developing for mobile devices, but now I try to stick to\ncross-platform tools (e.g. flutter [https://flutter.dev/]) so I'm not locked in.\nAnd if don't have access to the widest audience, well, marketing was never my\nstrong suit, anyway, and I get the most satisfaction from making apps that I\nlike.

But it does feel good to blog again.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"status:free","created_at":"2021-05-08T03:12:36.000Z","updated_at":"2021-05-08T03:15:04.000Z","published_at":"2021-05-08T03:15:04.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":"6270d8fd981c6c00315c2cee"},{"id":"60974f9e41e6a8003eaa7f9d","uuid":"a54759ec-93a9-418c-bc78-c546c1e79b29","title":"A Fugu Maze Review","slug":"a-fugu-maze-review","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-08-at-7.53.38-PM-1.png\",\"width\":680,\"height\":214}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-08-at-7.53.49-PM.png\",\"width\":934,\"height\":298}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-08-at-7.54.03-PM.png\",\"width\":904,\"height\":284}]],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fugu-maze/id295808255\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://technicat.itch.io/fugumaze\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Apple doesn't notify developers of new reviews, and even though I periodically check on the \"],[0,[0],1,\"App Store\"],[0,[],0,\", that only shows me reviews in the United States.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"So to see the latest reviews from other countries, I have to log in to App Store connect.

Meanwhile, the other patient\nwaiting there was on an oxygen tank because he'd contracted Covid back in\nJanuary.\n\nBut afterwards, I checked out that strip mall and stopped by a gelato place to\nget a drink for the summer heat and a dessert to replenish all the blood they\nextracted from me.\n\nAnd that's when I noticed they serve gelato for dogs, along with a hospitable\ndog watering hole.\n\nAnd that's when I knew I was in Summerlin.","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/06/E3166C3B-9EAD-4F67-9360-2A9E6E47D377.jpeg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2021-06-10T20:10:59.000Z","updated_at":"2021-06-10T20:38:01.000Z","published_at":"2021-06-10T20:35:34.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":"6270d8fd981c6c00315c2cee"},{"id":"60c78f5337bb87003ee363ae","uuid":"dab15742-db19-47d7-a791-2b895e98b0b2","title":"Happy Dragon Boat Festival!","slug":"happy-dragon-boat-festival","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/06/F4479CED-046F-484F-AD14-E0E4AAD9EF40.jpeg\",\"width\":4032,\"height\":3024}]],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Boat_Festival\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zongzi\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://taiwandeli.com/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.chinahighlights.com/festivals/dragon-boat-festival.htm\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"http://talkdimsum.com/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lo_mai_gai\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zongzi#Popular_original_myth\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Some of my Chinese colleagues informed me last week that this is the time for the \"],[0,[0],1,\"Dragon Boat Festival\"],[0,[],0,\" and it's traditional to have \"],[0,[1],1,\"zongzi\"],[0,[],0,\", sticky rice and other fillings wrapped in bamboo leaves.

I'm not suggesting they go as far as to pay people to move\nhere, like Tulsa [https://tulsaremote.com/], but take me for example:\n\nI sold my condo in California, got a much cheaper (and swankier) condo in\ndowntown Vegas, walking distance to numerous hipster, I mean third wave, coffee\nshops, a cool indie bookstore, 24-hr restaurants courtesy of the casinos (I just\nwish they'd offer some good Chinese food in a place that's not labeled\n\"pan-Asian\").\n\nI'm self-employed, so I set up an LLC entirely online and pay a single fixed\nyearly fee (including county business tax) also online, compared to the Stone\nAge postal registration and annual business tax filing nightmare in California\n(they owe me a refund on an overpayment, but I can't stand the thought of\nspending hours on hold again with theircall center).\n\nAnd if I need to go to California, it's a short flight (or one-day drive, if\nit's SoCal). Otherwise, I can just spend my extra disposable income at the\nbookstore to fill out my Zoom background like they do in all those Bloomberg\ninterviews.\n\nSo I think when they're not offering up our casino workers as Covid test cases\n[https://abcnews.go.com/US/las-vegas-mayor-slammed-suggesting-workers-covid-19/story?id=70306241] \nthey should make that kind of pitch.

We listened to anecdotes on how famous scientists experienced\ntheir ephiphanies and then we ran around smashing ice cubes (is that a band\nname?) to see who could make water the fastest.\n\nThat time would have been better spent reading a book like Leonard Midlow’s The\nUpright Thinkers\n[https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/223574/the-upright-thinkers-by-leonard-mlodinow/]\n, a recounting of the revolutions in scientific thought.\n\nA major message of the book is that science is a hard slog, and often it’s a\nhard slog going down the wrong path (much unlike the quick-fix resolutions in\nthe MacGyver episodes written by the author, who is not only a noted physicist\nbut a screenwriter).\n\nFor example, Newton didn’t havean apple fall on his head. Or he could have, but\nthat would have been just bad luck. Rather, after an emotionally deprived\nchildhood and working essentially as a grad student without a scholarship, he\nspent spent thirty years burning the midnight oil on alchemy before Edmund\nHalley (of Halley’s Comet fame) asked him to look over Kepler’s orbital laws,\nand then Newton spent another eighteen months burning the midnight oil putting\ntogether his Laws of Motion.\n\nEinstein did crank out three revolutionary theories in one year at his patent\noffice job, (which reminds me of the recent advice I received from a retired\nmailman telling me I should have worked for the post office). Still, he spent\nmuch of his career futilely trying to turn back the tide of quantum mechanics.\n\nAnd those are the success stories. For every crackpot theory that turned out to\nbe revolutionary, there are a bunch of crackpot theories that are still crackpot\ntheories and theorists who’ve only come up with crackpot theories.\n\nSo there are no easy answers or shortcuts to success. Instead, there’s hard work\nand perserverance, good luck, and being in the right place and the right time.\nAnd being born in the right place and right time, and right gender (there’s a\nreference to Lise Meitner, who co-discovered nuclear fission but missed out on\nthe Nobel).\n\nBut overall the book is an optimistic one, profiling those who were dedicated to\ntheir intellectual passions and eventually rewarded with brilliant insights, and\noverall furthering the march of human progress. And the author’s bio reminds us\nthat, whatever your main job is, don’t give up on your bookwriting and\nscreenwriting aspirations.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2021-11-09T04:05:43.000Z","updated_at":"2021-11-09T04:08:05.000Z","published_at":"2021-11-09T04:08:05.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null},{"id":"618a9ab43d771e003bf3ff09","uuid":"451ac7ad-f7d2-4e31-ae0e-f2d81a7b651c","title":"Spam Kings","slug":"spam-kings","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}]],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/spam-kings/9781491916124/\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"The circles in my personal vision of Hell are designated for the likes of car salesmen, the return department at Fry’s, phone and fax telemarketers, and SUV drivers who never signal.

Firefly is probably my second favorite TV series, next to Buffy the\nVampire Slayer, for the same reasons as as everyone else — the characters, the\nhumor, the writing, the visual effects and colorful vision of the future.\n\nBut none of the essays mentioned that in the Firefly universe, space is silent!\nI can’t think of any sci-fi on film since 2001: A Space Odyssey that didn’t\nallow sound (big booming spaceship and space weapon sounds) to travel through\nvacuum. Even the makers of the new Battlestar Galactica briefly considered\nshowing silent film space battles but fell back on the traditional noisy\ndogfights.\n\nNow, it would have been nice to see the Firefly crew floating around their\nvessel, but I understand television production budgets don’t allow for\nzero-gravity studios, yet.

Programmers get their fair share of\nglory, too — your eyes will glaze over as they discuss AI, game physics, 3D\nrendering, and the ever more complex game hardware. No one knows what producers\nreally do, but they’re often quoted in interviews and they accept game awards,\nso whatever it is, it must be important.\n\nUnfortunately, actually shipping a game involves inglorious tasks like testing\nand packaging, user interface implementation, and fulfilling all the detailed\nand sometimes conflicting requirements of publishers and hardware vendors. These\ntasks are often assumed to be “easy”, and they are — in the sense that digging a\nditch is easy, yet grueling and time-consuming.\n\nOne of these mundane yet crucial areas is localization — the process of\nconverting a program to run and appear correctly for a different part of the\nworld. More and more, it is assumed that console video game (as opposed to a PC\ngame), will be released in more than one region (US, Japan, Europe), and any\ngame that encounters success is sure to have additional localizations performed\n(I worked on a special-case French localization of an arcade game for a client\nin Montreal, to satisfy the local statute requiring mostly French text in just\nabout everything).\n\nYou can find a few articles here and there on localization, but now there is an\nentire book, Heather Maxwell Chandler’s The Game Localization Handbook,\npublished as part of Charles River Media’s sizable Game Development Series. The\nbook is ambitious in scope, covering the business case for localizations,\ndegrees of localization, the various assets that need to be localized, planning,\nbudgeting and executing the localization work either in-house or via outside\nvendors.\n\nThe author’s bio indicates she is a producer at Red Storm Entertainment, known\nas the developer of the Tom Clancy games. This background seems to correspond\nwith the strengths and weaknesses of this book. As a producer, she ably presents\nan overview of the cost-benefit analysis for localization and the available\nlevels of localization (ranging from none to just the packaging to full blown\nin-game text, graphics, and voiceovers).\n\nThe itemization of production and marketing stages for localization and\nchecklist of assets that potentially have to be localized fulfills the\n“handbook” part of the title. (Depending on what part of the production pipeline\nyou’re in, it’s easy to overlook things like manuals that have to be translated\nand reprinted, graphic symbols that make no sense in other parts of the world,\nand things that just won’t fly in certain countries, e.g. Nazi symbols are not\nallowed in Germany)\n\nBut as an independent developer (as opposed to a publisher), Red Storm likely\ncontracts out much of its localization work, and thus the Handbook provides tips\non finding and negotiating terms with localization contractors while the section\non in-house staffing is skimpy. And while I love seeing real sample project\ndocuments in these types of books (every practicing or aspiring game developer\nwants to know what people really charge), I’m a bit troubled by one sample quote\nthat spreads a fixed cost over multiple languages. What happens if the publisher\ndecides to forgo one language (and believe me, publishers change their minds all\nthe time)? You can say, excuse me while I recalculate all the numbers, or more\nlikely the publisher will take that increment out of your profit margin, if you\nhave any left (one publishing executive stated at a recent conference that a\ndeal that puts a developer out of business is a good deal).\n\nMaybe there is an element of political correctness in avoiding criticism of\npublishers or localization contractors — as an independent game developer, you\ndon’t want to antagonize them. But I’m a little surprised the book doesn’t\nmention that there can be many iterations due to shoddy work. On every\nlocalization project I’ve worked on, I’ve had coworkers point out that\ntranslations provided by the publisher were wrong (I highly recommend having an\ninternational staff). One group corrected half of their translations and then\nwent on vacation without telling me which half was fixed.\n\nThe book is weakest, not surprisingly, in its treatment of the technical issues.\nThe author hits a lot of the high points, but you get the feeling she’s\nregurgitating what she’s heard from the programmers on her team, or the snippets\nof developer interviews that are interspersed throughout the book. For example,\nshe mentions that for localization, game code should be Unicode or double-byte\nenabled, rather than using single bytes for each character.\n\nThings are a actually a bit more complicated — Unicode is an assignment of\nnumbers to every possible text character in the world (so indeed you need more\nthan one byte to represent that range of numbers), but there are a variety of\nways to represent that within a program, including double-byte but also schemes\nthat allow variable numbers of bytes, e.g. one byte for English text (same as\nASCII) and as many bytes as necessary for other character sets.\n\nBy the way, this isn’t particular to games — proper web pages are supposed to\nindicate what encoding they use, and quite possibly you’ve run into cases where\none byte included regular characters plus just enough more to handle a few\nEuropean languages (Latin-1).\n\nAnd the treatment of console issues doesn’t indicate the true pain you can\nencounter when you’re not developing for PC’s with their gobs of memory. Start\nwith a game running on a PC with 256MB, pretty much minimal today. A version\nrunning on the Xbox has only 64MB, which still isn’t too hard to work with. But\nthen move down to the Playstation 2 with it’s 32MB. And then the GameCube with\n24MB. If you double-byte all the text, you’re doubling the memory occupancy of\nthat text (we’ll ignore issues with data size on disc).\n\nAlso, additional or larger user interface elements (larger buttons and menu\nitems, name entry keyboards with more keys for a larger alphabet) take up\nmemory. The author describes the difference between the NTSC TVs we’re familiar\nwith in the US and the PAL TVs in Europe, but doesn’t note that the larger\nnumber of vertical lines also means a bigger chunk of memory used for display.\n(You can run into a lot of problems with the 60Hz vs. 50Hz difference, too)\n\nBut the biggest omission on the technical side isn’t in the details — rather\nit’s in the big picture. The author advocates, rightly, planning ahead for\nlocalization, and that is sufficient for well-defined tasks like translating the\nplayer manual. But the whole approach may leave the reader with the impression\nthat as long as the programmers have used the right coding techniques it’s just\na matter of dropping in translated assets when it comes time to make a European\nversion.\n\nThis is why we have crunch times. Not only should you plan ahead for\nlocalization, you should have localization from the beginning of the project on.\nThis doesn’t mean you have to have all the full German translations at the very\nstart, but it does mean you should have prototype German builds early on so you\ncan see there’s no way that word is going to fit on that tiny button.\n\nAnd you’ll know early if the PAL version will run out of memory or have weird\nobject collisions because of the different frame rate (I’ve run into both). On\none game where I started doing regular PAL builds early in the projects, I\nreally did just need to swap in translations at the end. On another project\nwhere it was more of an afterthought, the programmers didn’t even have PAL TV’s\nto test their changes.\n\nOverall, notwithstanding programmer gripes, this book is a welcome addition to\nthe game development literature (which was non-existent a decade ago).","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2021-11-13T21:47:41.000Z","updated_at":"2021-11-13T21:51:51.000Z","published_at":"2021-11-13T21:51:51.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null},{"id":"6191f09cac0f38003b57798a","uuid":"7c904a67-52d6-485c-a900-ef3cb649212b","title":"Counterfeiting and Car Chases, LA Style","slug":"counterfeiting-and-car-chases-la-style","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}]],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[[\"em\"]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[0],1,\"Originally written on Epinions in February 2004\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"I love movies about LA, ranging from Hollywood stories (The Player), comedies (LA Story), to the gritty noir pics based on Walter Mosley and James Ellroy novels (LA Confidential, Devil in a Blue Dress).\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"But the first and most hard-edged LA “locale” movie I remember seeing back in the eighties (dated by the Wang Chung soundtrack) is William Friedkin’s To Live and Die in LA, featuring a baby-faced William Petersen and John Pankow as secret service agents pursuing a master counterfeiter played by Willem Dafoe, who by the way was creepy back then, too.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"As in Friedkin’s notable works The French Connection and The Exorcist, the main characters in this film obviously have their demons (well OK, literally in the Exorcist) that push them onto self-destructive paths and into conflict with each other.

restaurants...).\n\nThe speech-to-text feature (to practice pronouncing dishes) doesn't seem to be\nworking, last time I checked (maybe time to do some open source plugin\ndebugging), some features I never got around to implementing in Flutter\n(highlighting the characters as they're spoken, again maybe needs some open\nsource augmentation), and some features like tags and links for each dish are in\nthe Android version but not yet added to the Cupertino UI, so I guess I have\nmore work to do (or just run the Android version on Macs, but I'm not that sore\nat Apple, yet!).","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2021-12-05T19:17:44.000Z","updated_at":"2021-12-05T19:44:55.000Z","published_at":"2021-12-05T19:44:55.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":"6270d8fd981c6c00315c2cee"},{"id":"61b5066d1b265a003bc03165","uuid":"9271d355-6913-4ea8-9be6-9e6116859d43","title":"Hyper

No. I’m assuring you, as a first-row\nwitness, that your support can save a soul.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2022-03-03T19:36:41.000Z","updated_at":"2022-03-03T20:36:29.000Z","published_at":"2022-03-03T20:25:02.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":"6270d8fd981c6c00315c2cee"},{"id":"62250163c9b407003df5971b","uuid":"337df8a6-8e9c-4aeb-8b36-3cd0a7bbcb2a","title":"Geometry for Programmers","slug":"untitled-39","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-06-at-10.43.40-AM.png\",\"width\":1710,\"height\":812}]],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://okaleniuk.medium.com/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://okaleniuk.medium.com/from-kyiv-to-everyone-644a712d441e\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.manning.com/books/geometry-for-programmers\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.sympy.org/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.manning.com/books/geometry-for-programmers#reviews\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://livebook.manning.com/book/geometry-for-programmers/discussion\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://wordsandbuttons.online/\"]]],\"sections\":[[10,0],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"In my previous post, I mentioned \"],[0,[0],1,\"Oleksandr Kaleniuk\"],[0,[],0,\" has been \"],[0,[1],1,\"posting from Kyiv\"],[0,[],0,\".

Asimov, Heinlein, Niven, Pohl...the usual\nsuspects.\n\nDuring my salaried days, it was more sporadic, a little William Gibson\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gibson], more Neal Stephenson\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Stephenson] (anything less than 500 pages).\nI wonder if he thinks \"if I had a dollar for every time...\" every time he sees\nthe word \"metaverse [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse].\"\n\nMaybe it's something about the pandemic, but I did some catching up on my sci-fi\nreading the last couple of years and expanded my horizons. Much of it isn't new,\nprobably considered \"classics\" now like my high school music (I still remember\nthe shock when the local \"best of the 60s and 70s classic rock\" stations\ntransitioned to \"best of the 60, 70s, and 80s classic rock\" station.\n\nFor instance, I remembered Ursula K. Le Guin\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_K._Le_Guin]'s short story The Ones Who\nWalk Away From Omelas\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ones_Who_Walk_Away_from_Omelas] from\nchildhood, but a rereading now packs an extra punch. Newer to me is her Hainish\nuniverse (I read The Left Hand of Darkness\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Left_Hand_of_Darkness]), in which gender is\nfluid, really fluid. And The Word for World is Forest\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Word_for_World_Is_Forest] is a strong\necological and anti-colonialist manifesto. Also, damned good fiction.\n\nOctavia Butler [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octavia_E._Butle], another\npioneer, also plays with gender, and inter-species mating, in her Xenogenesis\ntrilogy [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilith%27s_Brood] (I've read the first\ntwo books so far), slavery in Kindred\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindred_(novel)], and Parable of the Talents\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Talents_(novel)] is like a\ncrossover episode with The Handmaid's Tale. It's heavy stuff – I started with \nThe Patternmaster,\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patternist_series#Patternmaster_(1976)] her first\nnovel but chronologically the last in her Patternist\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patternist_series] series, which is lighter (but\nnot that light).\n\nI was pleasantly surprised to find a couple of non-stereotpyical Asian\ncharacters (a male love interest! from Hong Kong and a forceful Asian-American\nwoman) in her books, too, even though (spoiler alert!) they didn't last long.\nStill, it's progress from the Heinlein\n[https://www.tor.com/2010/08/12/heinlein-forward-looking-diversity-advocate-or-sexist-bigot-yes/] \nuniverse.\n\nIf you want Asian representation, you gotta have an Asian writer.

I enjoyed\nthe first two books of the trilogy (haven't got to the final one yet), but in\nparticular I find his short fiction moving particularly The Paper Menagerie\n[https://kenliu.name/blog/book/the-paper-menagerie-and-other-stories/] \ncollection (that story is included in the LeVar Burton Reads\n[https://www.levarburtonpodcast.com/] podcast).\n\nKen Liu also has translated part of Cixin Liu\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Cixin]'s Remembrance of Earth's Past\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_of_Earth%27s_Past] trilogy, which I\nalso thoroughly enjoyed until I read his New Yorker interview\n[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/06/24/liu-cixins-war-of-the-worlds] \ndefending, amongh other things, the Xinjiang internment, despite having written\na sci-fi saga that depicted aliens interning the entirety of human civilization.\nMaybe he's just trying to be subversive in his writing, but he's really throwing\nhimself into the partly line, a little hemming and hawing on the subject would\nbe nice.\n\nAnd I have to say I'm a bit disappointed in Kim Stanley Robinson\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Stanley_Robinson]'s China worship in his\nclimate collapse novel The Ministry of the Future\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ministry_for_the_Future#Critical_reception].\nPlenty of villains among the Russian oligarchs, and capitalism sucks, but those\nChinese (in particular a high-ranking inscrutable Chinese woman) are cool.\nAlmost as an afterthought at the end of the book (maybe really an afterthought),\nhe depicts HongKongers casting off the yokes of mainland oppression\nby...protesting a lot.
