I should probably concentrate on one language at a time, but breadth-first is how I roll, and for some reason Memrise is the first language app I’ve seen that lets you switch among languages.

It’s also nice to be able to switch back to a completed course for a refresher (especially as I alternate among my foreign language TV watching).

Duolingo, if you let me do that, I’ll go back to you.
