Ugh Ads

I hate seeing these “around the web” ads from Taboola and Outbrain (the tabloid style, the tabloid content, there’s always a blonde…), and tracking ads bug me so much I stopped retweeting or otherwise sharing web pages with them (they always advertise recent sites I visited, so it’s like seeing my browser history on every web site).

But now I’m seeing the Unity book I authored, while as pointless as any other tracking ad that’s showing me something I already know about, is kind of gratifying. See, it’s right here, next to requisite blonde.
