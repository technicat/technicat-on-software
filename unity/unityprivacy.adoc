Unity Privacy on Google Play

Last week, I received a bunch of emails from Google saying they’re removing (unpublishing) several of my apps that don’t conform to their privacy policy.

The apps in question use Unity Ads, so rather than cobble up my own privacy policy, in the Google Play Console, I link to Unity’s privacy policy.

Users who bother to read that privacy policy will find a lengthy section directed to game players. Here’s the first paragraph:

That still leaves the requirement for the in-game link. Unity has recommended explaining to Google that Unity Ads display a link to the privacy policy and an opt-out, but I’ve never figured out how to explain anything to Google (I’m not ever sure I’m even talking to a human), and I figure if you have to explain something once, you’ll have to explain it again, later.

So I recommend displaying a privacy policy link in-game using Unity’s privacy plugin (which I hear will be built into Unity 2018.3). So far, none of my games that use the plugin and link to Unity’s privacy policy in the store description have been removed.

Or, I could just stop showing ads, but I could use the spare change.
