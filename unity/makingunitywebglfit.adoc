Making Unity WebGL Fit

Unity provides a couple of HTML templates for WebGL builds, but I found early on I need my own custom template if only to remove the default margin that surrounds the content, particularly in games like HyperBowl that have a background which should fill the browser window.

The easiest way to create your own templates is to copy the WebGLTemplates folder in your Unity installation to the Assets folder of your Unity project.

Rename the copied template folders (I renamed Minimal and Default to FuguMinimal and FuguDefault), and start customizing! The change I wanted to add is to the stylesheet style.css. This removes the default margin.

canvas {width: 100%;height: 100%;position: absolute;}

Now, when I build, I can choose my slightly customized template.

And, after uploading to GameJolt, the WebGL content is centered properly without an unsightly white border.
