A convenient option to free up Unity Collaborate space for your other projects is to archive your project. But there’s archiving your project and then there’s archiving your project. I almost made the mistake of choosing the archive option under Settings in the Unity Services Dashboard.

That’s not just archiving, that’s deactivating your project in Unity Services. You can always unarchive/reactivate it later, but in the meantime any Unity Services like ads, IAP, multiplayer, will stop working for your app.

To archive just the project in Collaborate, go to the Storage options in Collaborate.

This will not affect the other Unity Services. I think there should be some greater distinction in the wording between archiving a project in Collaborate and archiving a project period. Or just use different words.
