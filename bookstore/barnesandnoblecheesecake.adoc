I’ve been buying Barnes and Noble stock using the same strategy that led me to buy Pets.com just before the dot-com crash (the first one). I like using the product and I can’t believe it’ll just disappear. Maybe that’s just because I live in the Las Vegas area where there’s no other non-used bookstore except one indie bookstore downtown (although compared to Amazon, I’m beginning to think of Barnes and Noble as an indie bookstore). There is an excellent used bookstore, though (if you visit, be sure to ask the owner about the name).

Even if Barnes and Noble’s book sales tanks, there’s always their coffee business. It looks like Starbucks, serves Starbucks, but as they constantly have to tell customers, it’s not Starbucks. Its actually better than Starbucks, as they serve Cheesecake Factory cheesecake (and I like their other desserts, too).

If I go there every week (which I’m on track to do), I’ll just get my discount’s worth from my Barnes and Noble membership. But I usually make a point of buying a book to read with my coffee. Maybe the book business will be just fine.
