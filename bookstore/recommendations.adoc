While I’m waiting for the local indie bookstore Writer’s Block to reopen, I’ve been doing more of my book shopping on the Barnes and Noble site, partly to avoid Amazon, and largely because I get a gift card every couple of months from copious use of my Barnes and Noble credit card.

But I also like the experience. I think the site has been improving (I remember not being that impressed with it a couple of years ago) and it’s nice ordering a book, many of them with free shipping, without constant prompts to sign up for Amazon Prime.

Compared with Amazon, I always felt that Barnes and Noble, despite getting flak for being a chain, actually likes books (same with Borders, RIP). I think a sign of that is having nice book recommendation features, like this book graph. I’m a sucker for graphs.

The book match feature works well, too.

But my favorite recommendations are recommendations by real people, in this case authors and their store staff (a feature I like in the stores, too).

Surprisingly, or not surprisingly, I find the staff recommendations more interesting than those from the authors.

Keep it up, BN! I don’t want to go back to Amazon.
