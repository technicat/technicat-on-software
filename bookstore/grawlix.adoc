I’ve long thought it an inconvience that there doesn’t seem to be a standard for grawlixes, the seemingly random assortment of swear-substitution characters that often require urlencoding.

But I saw today on a Target bookshelf, in an apparent display of whimsy, they collected two books that use the same grawlix in their titles.

I don’t know if it’s coincidental or a publishing standard (I’ll have to dig out my copy of The Chicago Manual of Style). But it makes sense. Now you can search book catalogs for #@%! and you’ll get at least these two books.
