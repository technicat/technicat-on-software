It’s annoying when companies pretend to forget you unsubscribed from their marketing email, but sometimes it’s effective. After a summer sale email from Smashwords showed up, I had to reset my password just to log in to unsubscribe again, and in the process I discovered they now have epub support.

Their previous Word-only support was a deal-killer when I last checked them out, but this time I decided why not try uploading the same epub for Technicat on Software that I self-publish on Amazon.

It sort of worked. The book is now on Smashwords and you can buy it, but the epub requires some markup changes to be included in their “premium catalog” which I gather means all the various devices and distribution channels they support. But it did get pirated quickly (on ebookinga, a site that strenuously insists it’s not a piracy site and you’d better get a lawyer and plan to spend money if you file a DCMA).

In Smashword’s defense, they do say their epub support is in beta (they call it Smashwords Direct, I think), and it’s still a Word-centric publishing world. Amazon doesn’t support epub that well, either (it drops the Table of Contents).

Actually, the thing that annoys me the most on Smashwords has nothing to do with publishing — I can’t see any way to log out of my account. Well, that and my disappearing unsubscribe.
