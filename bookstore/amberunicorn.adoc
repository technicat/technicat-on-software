Recently, Lou Donato of Amber Unicorn Books passed away. The story of how he set up the bookstore, met his wife, and has been supporting the local bookstore scene is a great one.

Amber Unicorn is one of the first places I checked out when I moved to Las Vegas, and during my first visit I asked Lou how he came up with the name of the store. He said he chose Amber so the store would show up at the beginning of the yellow page listings, and Unicorn because his wife likes unicorns. Now that’s another great story.
