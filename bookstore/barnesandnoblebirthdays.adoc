I wasn’t that enthusiastic about the Barnes and Noble membership when I first signed up for it years ago. I don’t like to pay for a membership to get discounts (so no Costco for me), and at the time I had a free Borders corporate membership that gave me a bigger discount. Also, it was annoying that the B&N membership automatically charged my card without warning a month before renewal.

But Borders is gone, I think of B&N as an indie bookstore fighting the good fight against Amazon, I’m now set up for manual renewals of my B&N membership, and I like this kid’s club thing where they’ll send you birthday coupons for up to twelve of your kids (what maniac would have twelve kids?). I’m not sure I even have twelve nieces and nephews, but I added some of them. Here’s a recent birthday coupon for my sister’s youngest kid.
