= Explore with Twitter

My latest method of avoiding the mixture of banality and toxicity known as Twitter Trends is to go far far away — specifically, in Settings, Content Preferences, and then Explore Settings, tell twitter not to show what’s happening around you, and pick some other country to Explore.


Of course, twitter trends is likely to be annoying everywhere, so the trick is to pick a place with a language you can’t read. I picked South Korea for now (actually, I can read the Korean alphabet, which is a very cool alphabet, but I have almost no vocabulary).

Now, the trends are merely decorative, or educational should you decide to learn the language. Either way, it’s an improvement!
