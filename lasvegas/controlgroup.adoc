Our mayor recently threw her hat in the ring for most homicidal wack job politician in the US (this was before the bleach injection press conference) when she offered the population of Las Vegas up as a control group for coronavirus mitigation (“Give us the placebo!”).

While we’re not a control group, yet (maybe Georgia will step up first), but we do have a before and after. I’ve been recording the daily case updates from the Southern Nevada Health District since before the state’s shutdown.

The bad news is we’re still getting over a hundred new cases a day, over three thousand cases total so far, but at least it’s the daily increase has been in the low hundreds range since the beginning of April.

That constant increase is an improvement over the doubling every few days that was happening before, and it commenced a couple of weeks after the shutdown was initiated on March 18, which is about the amount of time you’d expect mitigation practices to show an effect.

So we’re not out of the woods, yet, but it could have been a lot worse. I’m glad we didn’t take the placebo.
