The daily numbers from the Southern Nevada Health District for Clark County (basically the Las Vegas area)

The peak, over a thousand cases a day, is ten times the first peak after the state-wide shutdown commenced. After a gradual decline, the numbers went up sharply when just about every business except brothels reopened, with distancing and mask requirements for businesses (but not customers).

A mask directive for everyone in public spaces was issued on June 24, and bars were closed again shortly after. Also, the City of Las Vegas, after three months of studiously avoiding any safety messaging, got religion and learned how to spell “mask”.

So it seems we’re on the way back down again, but still at hundreds of new cases a day. And keep in mind the numbers particularly for the previous two weeks get updated upward, so in the past peaks that I thought were peaks were just a bump in the road.
