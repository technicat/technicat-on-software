The Millennium Fandom Bar is just down the street from my place and the type of place I would visit all the time if it was a coffee shop. But it’s a bar and I rarely drink, so I haven’t been since last year, when I attended an MIT alumni gathering there. It was a good time, talking about comic books, comic book movies, Star Trek, electric vehicles, Harry Potter…so last night I figured, it’s been a year, I should drop in again.

Even without the MIT grads, it had an agreeably geeky vibe. Apparently, there was a long-running D&D game in session. One of the players was wearing this appropriate t-shirt.
