I deleted my Facebook account last year but only just got around to browsing the account data I saved. It makes me wish I’d deleted Facebook earlier.

For example, it amazes me there isn’t more fuss about how you can’t opt out of a constant stream of people and companies uploading information about you to reach you with ads.

The companies that upload your information shouldn’t get a pass, either. This, by the way, is why I don’t go to open houses anymore and try to avoid dealing with realtors.

And Facebook’s calculation of my ad interests, besides being creepy, is rather disappointing. I never once saw an ad about Ada.
