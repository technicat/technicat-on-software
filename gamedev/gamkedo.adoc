I’m not sure why, but I have podcast phases: I go for a stretch listening to podcasts every day and then months where I don’t. For some reason I just started again, maybe because I upgraded my iPhone, and I was pleased to see my interview podcast with Chris DeLeon still there (although I think he renamed it from Game Devs Like You to gamkedo.community), and also new episodes from his podcast.

There’s good stuff. For example, the most recent interview is with a developer of a snail simulator written in PHP over two years. And there’s more. More than fifty more episodes, in fact!

If you take a gander, check out my interview. I find it interesting just because my voice always sounds different to me when I hear it recorded.
