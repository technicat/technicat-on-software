I keep talking about trying out some different game engines, and Unity’s support for Aptoide might have finally pushed me over. Today I looked into Godot and Unreal (I suppose there’s still CryEngine but it doesn’t seem to have that much momentum these days).

Godot is appealing because it’s open source, and the workflow looks interesting (lot of similarities to Unity, I think), but they don’t have an FBX importer and I have lots of FBX if I want to try porting HyperBowl to it.

Also, Tim Sweeney seems cool (in comparison to John Riccitiello — not that I know the guy, but I saw an interview where he disparaged Epic, which made me want to switch to Epic. Way to go).

So I’m leaning toward Unreal. I’ve worked with Unreal before, so it’s not as exciting as trying something completely new, but it’s been a while (I was using Unrealscript which is no longer), and I need to do some refreshing.

Their online documentation has an old web feel to it, but their Trello board looks good!
