It was one of those projects where knowing what I know now, I would have avoided it like the plague (I was so mad at the end that I removed my name from the credits), but I did learn stuff and it was an accomplishment, and I even wrote a GameCube postmortem that was published on the Nintendo developer site and Gamasutra.

It showed up in the bargain bin almost immediately after release and I’ve only occasionally found it in used game stores, but one thing you find with game development is that if you can just get the damned thing out the door, someone will like it.
