A convenient (and occasionally inconvenient) aspect of the Unity Player Settings is that some of the settings are shared across build targets. These properties are indicated by asterisks.

But sometimes they’re wrong. In the example above, the Scripting Runtime Version is shared across targets, but I just discovered the API Compatibility Level isn’t. Scripting Define Symbols isn’t either (and you wouldn’t want it to be).

So, the lesson here is to check the player settings for each target, and don’t believe the stars.
