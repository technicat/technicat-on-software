Remember that catchphrase “Weebles wobble but they don’t fall down!”? Probably not, but it came to mind when I updated HyperBowl recently and noticed, apparently due to a new physics engine, some objects that rest on non-flat surfaces now fall down immediately. Like a vase in the Rome lane, and the pines in the Snowpark lane.

The fix/workaround which I probably should have done before anyway is to put invisible box colliders underneath the objects (and by the way, here you can also see primitive collider composition of the pins).

Invisible colliders are the Band-Aids of level design.
