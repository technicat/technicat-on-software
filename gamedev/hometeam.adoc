About five years ago, I did a podcast interview with Game Devs Like You, which has since been renamed HomeTeam GameDev. I noticed also the podcast site has been revamped — it looks great, and a bonus, the individual episode pages embed nicely in Medium!

So I’m going to list a small sample here (there are over a hundred and fifty HomeTeam GameDev podcasts so I’m way behind)

Starting with my interview, and listening it to again, my reaction was that I don’t recognize my voice.

I follow McFunkypants, of 1 Game a Month fame, on twitter, and I believe I submitted a question for this episode, asking how he got the name McFunkypants.

While I’m writing this, I’m listening to the latest episode, which has some incisive observations about the state of educational games.

Some of the interviewees have worked on major titles. Metroid Prime 2!

It’s not all fun and games (ha ha). Listen to an IP attorney.

I paid close to attention to this interview with a slot machine programmer, because I live in Las Vegas and I might need a job some day.

A game artist’s perspective

A game artist-turned-programmer’s perspective.

Another twitter presence I follow, VR specialist.

And many more…
