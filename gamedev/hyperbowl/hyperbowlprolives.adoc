I removed the paid Pro version of HyperBowl on Google Play long ago due to slow sales, updates regularly showing up on pirate sites (complete with harvested Google Play descriptions) within minutes of their release, and, the final straw, users demanding their $.99 back and threatening me with one-star ratings if I didn’t do what they want (reviews should be written in a ransom font).

But HyperBowl Pro lives on. I just saw it show up on another pirate site, with my this-is-why-we-can’t-have-nice-things complaint intact.

Like it says, you can still download the really free version of HyperBowl on Google Play. Pro tip: include a note for piracy site visitors in your Google Play description!
