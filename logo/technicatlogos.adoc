Following on from the post of the Fugu Games logo design, here’s the design process of the Technicat logo, also from Shane Nakamura Designs.

This time around, I liked several, including the one near the lower left, but that one reminded me a bit too much of Harvard, and it had a similar form to the Fugu Games logo. The two in the second row from the top feature a nice non-rectangular shape, cool lettering, and neat asymmetric facial features (I’m embarrassed that I didn’t realize they were gamepad controls, but everyone else gets it). The curved enclosure on the left one reminds me of a cat looking out of a pet carrier, so the winner:

But the story doesn’t end there. Logos are fun. I wouldn’t mind commissioning a new logo every year. Recently, I found out the barista at one of my regular coffee spots also does some hand-drawn artwork, so here’s a new one from Dakota Snow:
