= If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor

Bruce Campbell’s self-deprecating wit pervades his memoir, self-deprecatingly and wittily titled If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor.

Nonetheless, his unself-pitying account of the toll his career took on his marriage and finances, not to mention days caked in syrup (fake blood) and freezing nights in decrepit cabins, shows how tough it is to make a go of it in Hollywood.

But with a career that includes the Evil Dead movies, the TV series Brisco County, Jr., appearances on Homicide and Xena and friends like the Raimis and Cohen brothers, he’s got plenty to be proud of. And it was good to see him on Burn Notice. Groovy!
