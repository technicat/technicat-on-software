One nice thing about having my book on Apple Books is that I can finally put a badge on my web site. For Amazon and Barnes and Noble, I have to make do with old-fashioned links (although Amazon does have a badge for the Amazon Appstore).

But the Apple badge doesn’t work well with author links, or rather the author links don’t work well. If instead of linking to a specific book page, like this:

I link to the View More by this Author link (which gratifyingly is an “artist” URL), the resulting page shows a bunch of music which was partly made by another me.

On iOS, this is all you see, as it brings you into the iTunes app, not the iBooks app. On other devices, at least you can scroll down and see the books I wanted you to see.

Barnes and Noble has a less severe version of this problem. It also is basically just searching for anything with my name and thus includes a bird book not by me.

Only Amazon does it right. They let you indicate which books you’ve authored or coauthored and give you an author page under your control.

It’s not the prettiest thing, but it lets you include a blurb, link a blog, etc.

And there’s an “author central” site where you can check how much of a world-famous author you are. Hey, I’m in the top one million!
