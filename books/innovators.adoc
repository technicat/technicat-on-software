Hated It

It’s always annoying to hear anti-tech complaints that sound like a teenager complaining about having to take a science class, but this is the first time I’ve seen it in a book review.

First of all, if something is beyond your understanding, you don’t have to hate it. And the book in question is Walter Isaacson’s The Innovators, which is more biographical than technical. It profiles the people responsible for the early conception of the computer up to the present day Internet.

That roster includes a lot of colorful personalities and more women than is commonly known, including Ada, Countess of Lovelace, daughter of Lord Byron and first person to write down a computer program, the women of ENIAC (great band name), and Admiral Grace Hopper of COBOL fame (making a comeback in New Jersey).

There’s plenty to learn for non-nerds, and it’s entertaining (the escapades of Ada have more the flavor of a comic book than a dusty history book), stop hating, you big whiner.
