= Winners Dream

Bill McDermott’s autobiography Winners Dream (or is it Winner’s Dream?) is not a particularly insightful business study, and the book drags a bit toward the end where I would expect details of SAP business and recent strategy to be more interesting.

But it’s hard not to moved by the author’s enthusiastic recounting of his youth and how he worked his way up to where he is now. In real life, working with rah-rah exuberant salespeople can drive me nuts, but this bio gives me a little more understanding of what it takes to survive in that tough business.

And hey, the guy is running SAP, now.
