The Social Library

Library web sites have come a long way. Take for example the site for the Las Vegas-Clark County libraries run by BiblioCommons, which powers many other library systems, including the last three I’ve been a member of (Las Vegas, San Diego, and San Mateo County).

The site look polished, on par with dot com sites (and frankly, I think it looks better than Goodreads and Amazon, but maybe the absence of ads has something to do with it). And it’s well-designed. Upon login and even before, it features quick menu links to the most frequently accessed features.

For me, usually the task at hand is to see what books I have checked out and to renew them if necessary (they send a reminder email three days before the due dates). That page features convenient one-click renewals, and as a bonus, one-click ratings (it wouldn’t be dot-com without a five-star rating system).

The page also shows if someone is waiting for the book, in which case you can’t renew it. And of course, you can place a hold for a book on the web site.

Another social media must-have: a public profile, which shows, like Goodreads, your shelved books (you start off with Completed and In-Progress shelves, and again there is convenient one-click shelving from pretty much anywhere you see a book), the usual Activity feed, and the book lists and community features which I haven’t used.

You can control what components of your profile are public, although I don’t see any way to completely hide your profile.

My only complaint is the lack of a share-to-twitter option. After all, it is social media.
