I recently received a book royalty statement reporting $1.78 in revenue and asked on twitter what I should do with it? Someone suggested a donation, which is a good suggestion, but $1.78 isn’t much, but that reminded me I have points I can donate.

I don’t travel much, so my frequent flyer points are just sitting there, and JetBlue makes it really easy to donate on their web site. Just go to the Redeem Points page, select the easily visible Donate option, and pick a charity.

And that reminded me I have a bunch of hotel points sitting idle. I had to google for the Marriott point donation page, but it’s there and even on its own web site.

In fifteen years I’ve never accumulated enough Best Western points to reserve a room, but I do have enough to donate. Their page is not as slick as Marriott’s, but easy to find like Jet Blue’s on their redemption page and a pretty decent selection. Also, they have a number of Canadian charities on their list.

Don’t let your points gather dust or expire! Donate!
