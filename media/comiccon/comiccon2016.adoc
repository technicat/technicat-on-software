Comic Con is my one annual event now, gone seven or eight times yearly (losing track now) with perhaps one skipped year. It’s my first year living in Las Vegas, and the first time I’ve flown out since moving here.

Plenty of parking on the roof.

Spirit Air likes to send alarming emails warning you to arrive hours in advance, but the airport’s not that busy.

And it was smooth sailing in San Diego. With a premailed badge, it’s just a matter of walking in and picking up the bag, lanyard and guides. Within a half hour, someone asked to exchange their iZombie bag for my Supergirl bag. Deal.

First contact (with a cosplayer) before preview night.

And some early-to-rise cosplayers in the Hard Rock lobby (5AM the next morning).

Apparently they were here for a photo shoot, conveniently visible from my hotel room. Some stormtroopers joined them.

The room was also a great vantage point to see the fireworks from behind the convention center. I have no idea what they were for, except they did coincide with the Star Trek screening. I could have done without the poolside party to 2AM (or at least they could have invited me).

These guys look like cosplayers but they’re just statues in the lobby of the Hyatt.

By the Hyatt is Seaport Village, a great place to relax and get away from the con crowd. The only non-used bookstore downtown is The Upstart Crow Bookstore and Cafe. To beat the unusual San Diego heat and humidity, I paid a visit to Gelato Paradiso regularly, in The Headquarters (used to be the police headquarters — check out the old jail next to the bathrooms). Also, check out the truffles at Dallmann’s Confections. The manager Arielle is a cosplayer.

Another favorite haunt is the Cat Cafe.

Besides the cats, they have pokemon.

I only do Comic Con for 2–3 days, so time to leave. San Diego airport is a small airport, but I like it. A bit artsy, and I can kill time at the Warwick’s and Bay Books (what does it say about San Diego that the best bookstores around downtown are at the airport). I usually pick up a snack at Elegant Desserts (they also offer donuts from Donut Bar), this time had a nice talk with the manager about languages (she’s Swedish, but lived in Japan and travelled Asia) and the move to cashless society.

Now I’m back in Las Vegas and missing that San Diego humidity.
