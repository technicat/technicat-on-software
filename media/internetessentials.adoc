I go through these phases where I turn decide to get with the efficiency program and turn on automatic and paperless billing. Then something happens like a bill doesn’t show up or I don’t notice a payment increase and I turn them back off.

That’s what happened with my cable bill, recently. After I turned on automatic billing, it went up two months in a row, so I turned off automatic billing and removed the TV service, which I only have because somehow it supposedly reduced my total bill a year earlier.

Inconveniently, the Cox web site lets you upgrade your service online but not downgrade or remove any service. You have to call (and then wait on hold for thirty minutes listening to the same insipid music and then talk to someone who want to know “What kind of TV do you watch?”).

The web site doesn’t even list downgrade options, so I’m just assuming I have the lowest Internet package because it’s called “Essential Internet.” However, I seem to be paying for a lot of non-essential stuff:

I don’t use any of the email accounts, nor the Cox Security Suite Plus, nor as far as I know the Panoramic WiFi (unless “panoramic” means “frequent disconnections”). And the 30Mbps is a surprise to me. On a good day I might get 20.

I’ll take the Less Than Essential Internet, if you’ve got it.
