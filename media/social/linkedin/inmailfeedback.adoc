One thing that really annoyed me about all the recruiter InMail I used to get on LinkedIn (besides receiving them), was the consistently high InMail feedback ratings listed for each recruiter. Further investigation (googling) revealed that recruiters received a top score just by getting a few replies, there’s no actual rating involved.

I just discovered the feedback ratings are gone. The explanatory paragraph explains nothing, but I’m guessing the real reason is “They’re onto us.”
