Probably my least favorite aspect of Medium has been its home feed, which is unfortunate, considering how prominent a feature it is in this type of app. I basically got tired of selecting “Show me fewer stories like this” and wanted to say, “AI, you’re fired!” So I welcome their new home feed reorg, replacing that single feed with “curated” topics.

I don’t know what they mean by “curated” – do they mean the list of topics or the stories? Human-curated or AI-curated? In any case, I didn’t find them to be an improvement, but the important thing is that I can opt to select no topics, leaving me with just a feed of stories written by people I follow. Like on twitter.

There’s still some other stuff I’m not interested in, but that’s below and off-screen. You might wonder how I’m going to see potentially interesting stories outside my network. Well, even before this, I find them on twitter.
