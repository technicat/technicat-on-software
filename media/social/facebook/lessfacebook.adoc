I’m a Little Less Facebook

Google has backed off it’s original “Don’t be evil” motto, but they could retain some of that moral righteousness by settling for “Don’t be like Facebook” (and also if they can refrain from jumping into the Chinese censorship business).

I already reduced my Facebook account to a shell, unfriending all friends, unliking all pages, and leaving all groups (it sounds so antisocial!), just using the account to manage the Facebook pages for my company and apps.

But Facebook just keeps doing what it does, to borrow a phrase “crying crocodile tears” every time they get caught and promising not to do it again. So with this latest discovery of their snooping app, I’m thinking of removing my Facebook pages. The first step is to remove links to them from my web site.

Not only do I feel less tainted, the web site is a bit cleaner now that I’ve removed four badges. And yeah, there’s still an instagram icon, so maybe that should go next (I’m still actively using instagram, but mostly for food photos).

I still have to remove the pages. Two of them are fairly inactive, so no problem there, but I’ll have to ponder about the remaining two (for HyperBowl and Talk Dim Sum) as I get most of my user feedback from those. I suppose I can tell everyone to find me on twitter (shudder).
