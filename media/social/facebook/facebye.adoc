Finally, I deleted my Facebook account.

It’s long overdue. I have a rule that I should delete a social media account if I keep complaining about it, I call it the LinkedIn rule, but really, it applies to any company that shows signs of early moral bankruptcy.

I deleted LinkedIn for their business model’s enabling of recruiter spam. I avoided using Uber ever since their call-cancel sabotage of Lyft. And even before Cambridge Analytica, the way Facebook hid their privacy options and constantly opted users into sharing by default was full on weasel.

Facebook is useful for keeping in touch with high school classmates and I get good customer interaction with Facebook pages (in particular, for my HyperBowl and Talk Dim Sum apps). So, social media conditioned as I am, it pains me to lose around a thousand page followers, but hopefully they can find me elsewhere (twitter, itch.io…) and I don’t know that those pages really made a difference in terms of sales.

As for my high school classmates, well, I’m probably never going to another high school reunion in Iowa, and, well, I’m still on instagram (baby steps).
