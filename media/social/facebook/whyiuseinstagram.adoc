Why I Use Instagram

I’d like to say I use Instagram as part of an overarching social media strategy, but to tell you the truth I only started using it recently, for the following reasons:

    My sister said I should use it. She has a lot more followers, and she’s the one who said I should start using Facebook and Twitter.
    As one would expect, Instagram shares easily with Facebook. I used to use Pinterest a lot (and I still like it better than Instagram), but when their shares to Facebook started to not look so good, I started posting photos directly to Facebook. This is also one reason I stopped using Foursquare. Well played, Facebook.
    My Facebook friends complained I wasn’t performing checkins with the photos that I posted. That happens more or less automatically with my Instagram photos, so now, Instagram first.
    It seems more of my friends (Facebook and otherwise) are active on Instagram.

However, the number of Instagram photos I share to Facebook is diminishing, because:

    Facebook kept nagging me to write a review of my recent checkins.
    I’m more likely to post photos on Instagram that I wouldn’t post on Facebook.
    I post a lot of food photos, and some of my white Facebook friends go “Ewww!” when they see unfamiliar foods. (Don’t get me wrong, some of my best Facebook friends are white, but sometimes I feel like a need to add a #NSFWP tag — not safe for white people).

So you could say that I’m using Instagram more because I’m using Facebook less. Not so well played, Facebook.
