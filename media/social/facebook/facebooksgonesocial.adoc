Facebook’s Gone Social

In the past, I noticed the major social platforms haven’t been that social in talking to each other, while they’ve been busy copying each other. I think this is a big reason why Google+ didn’t take the world by storm. At least, it’s the big reason why I never used it much.

However, I saw Instagram more sharing options (you can tell it’s more, because they’re crammed into an awkwardly introduced button), and I just realized today that Facebook now lets you add links to some social networks on your profile.

One tip that would have saved me some time: although it says “links”, you need to enter your usernames, not the entire URL.
