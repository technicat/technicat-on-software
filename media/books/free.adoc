= Free: The Future of a Radical Price

Like the author’s well-known book https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Tail_(book)[The Long Tail], I felt Chris Anderson’s more recent book https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free:_The_Future_of_a_Radical_Price[Free: The Future of a Radical Price] would have been fine as a Wired article but suffers from being artificially stretched to book length. It overreaches, citing anything remotely related to free, even including the term “free lunch” as an example.

As in other works of this ilk, the author breathlessly extols the new world order while understating the challenges this poses to those who reside in the “long tail.”

Ironically, I found this book in the bargain section of Office Depot.
