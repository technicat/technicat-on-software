I’m rooting for Barnes and Noble, and not just because I have their stock. These days, I think of them as an indie bookstore, at least compared to the soullessness and Borg-like inevitability of Amazon. And I really do feel the company has a genuine love of books. It’s why I subscribe to their twitter feed, and why I started using their new Browsery app.

At first, I thought I might be able to use it as a replacement for Goodreads (now part of Amazon), but it’s not a book-tracking and rating/review app, although sometimes I wish it had those features. Rather, it’s almost strictly a Q&A app, where users ask for book recommendations and others provide the recommendations.

At first I thought this was a strange app idea, not exactly an act of desperation, but kind of random. But I do find it addictive. Its focus, with a refreshing lack of thumbs and stars, provides a real book-club feel, and I spend a lot of time trying to remember books to recommend. Which I still go back to Goodreads to find, but hey, just as I like going to multiple bookstores, I don’t mind using more than one book app.
