Stay HomeÂ Reading
The activity I miss the most during this shutdown is browsing my local bookshop and getting a coffee while I'm there.
So I've learned to make my own pour overs and I can still support my local bookstore by ordering books online and walking over for curbside pickup. As for the browsing, well, I perform a facsimile by reading the ebook samples on my nook app (no more Amazon for me).
And by the way, Barnes and Noble also has curbside delivery and delivery by mail is usually free, but in the spirit of minimizing now I'm going with the ebook option. I have a habit of rebuying and rereading Snow Crash and The Diamond Age over and over, so I'm starting my ebook scifi collection with those.
