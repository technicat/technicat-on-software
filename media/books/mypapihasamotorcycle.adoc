= My Papi Has a Motorcycle

It’s Father’s Day this Sunday, so if you’re still looking for a gift or just remembered because you’re reading this, I suggest this fun little book https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/588648/my-papi-has-a-motorcycle-by-isabel-quintero-illustrated-by-zeke-pena/[My Papi Has a Motorcycle].

I spied it in the kids section of my neighborhood indie bookstore The Writer’s Block, got myself a copy, read it over coffee and a cookie (my regular routine there), and just ordered one for my dad on bn.com.

I price-compared with amazon, and it’s about the same price — amazon is cheaper but bn has free 2–3 day shipping (so it might get there in time) and doesn’t bug you to sign up for a credit card or amazon prime.

I’m not a girl or Mexican-American and my dad didn’t ride a motorcycle, but he is an immigrant, we did live in California, and most importantly, it’s about a dad being a dad. So I think he’ll like it.
