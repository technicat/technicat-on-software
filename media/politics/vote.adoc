I’ve been a Nevada resident for two years, now, and I’ve been impressed how convenient they make voting. They have weeks of early voting at many convenient locations and hours, including weekends. I’ve voted at a supermarket, a mall, and the county government building (that one is walking distance to my place).

It’s still not quite as convenient as mailing in a ballot, like I was doing in California, but I just received a letter with a form to request a mail-in ballot. They even do hard sell on it, pointing out it’s easier to research (i.e. google) while filling in the ballot.

And, as if I need some more encouragement to vote, the notes your participation so far and compares it to the average.

That’s pretty depressing. The average voter participation is about fifty percent. Vote!
