One of my free TV streaming sources is the Tubi app, and one of the shows I started watching is Leverage, currently included in the scrolling list of featured videos at the top of the app.

At first glance, you might think that is what passes for a reasonably diverse cast in a TV show, but I scrolled through the rest of the features and of the twenty actors displayed only five are women and one is not white.

This didn’t bother me in my early TV watching years, when I happily binge-watched Cheers, but I’ve been watching TV for fifty years now, and these days sometimes I just watch the first few minutes of a show and exclaim (to myself), I can’t watch another show about white people!

And then I turn to Korean drama. It’s not like I feel a cultural connection. I don’t know the language and not much of the history, but I’ve learned a bit of both by watching lots of it, as my Tubi recommendations indicate.

It’s just nice to see some Asians on TV, even if they’re not Asian Americans.
