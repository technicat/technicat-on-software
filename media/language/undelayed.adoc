One of the great technological advances of recent years in the airline industry is text updates. More than once, I’ve been in a terminal with angry passengers haranguing beleagured airline staff who are the last to know, while I got the latest scoop via text (which makes you wonder, shouldn’t they just check their phones?)

Although I suppose you can have too much information. My latest flight was delayed, delayed, delayed, then undelayed. That might be why a full flight had a lot of empty seats. And I learned a new word. Apparently, “undelayed” is airlinespeak for “never mind.”
