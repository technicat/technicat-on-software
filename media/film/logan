= Logan

I was listening to the /Film podcast review of Logan and remembered that while it was one of my favorite films of the year (and second favorite superhero film), I had a few quibbles. I thought the Shane thing was a bit heavy-handed, it was uncomfortable watching little kids dishing out so much violence (a problem I also had to a lesser extent with Kick Ass), even more uncomfortable watching a plot premise that involves a government organization imprisoning and traumatizing children (bad enough in a film and worse in real life). And, really, staying over at an innocent bystander’s place while the bad guys are tracking you, and surprised when the bad guys wipe out all the innocent bystanders? That’s superhero malpractice.

All that goes with movie territory, but the one thing that really bugged me is the discovered DNA link between Wolverine and the girl, which Prof. Xavier keeps reminding Wolverine of (“She’s your daughter!”). As if a failed paternity test would result in Wolverine dumping off the kid at the nearest gas station.

In fact, I think the emotional payoff at the end would have been even more impactful without the genetic relationship setting it up.

The movie is about an adoptive relationship, where they ultimately learn how to trust and take care of each other. There’s no need to justify it with a circumstantial biological link. I mean, they’ve both got knives coming out of their hands. That’s kinship enough.
