Cinefex 156 is now available on Cinefex iPad Edition, and although the film featured on the cover is Thor: Ragnarok (which I haven’t watched, yet), the one I’m pleased to see in this issue is Wonder Woman, which was my favorite film of the year, certainly the most emotionally compelling.

Logan was good, too, but a bit melodramatic, and I felt the father-daughter relationship would have had more impact if it didn’t rely on their actually having a biological father-daughter relationship. Blade Runner was beautiful, but like the original, a bit emotionally distant, and, like the original, it would be nice to see a more diverse main cast in this otherwise culturally diverse future (you can actually see more diversity in present-day LA). Guardians of the Galaxy was pretty entertaining. And I haven’t even seen the new Star Wars, yet. The only movie I regretted watching in the theater was Kong: Skull Island. So, a pretty good year for film.
