Colin Powell
You can score some interesting reading in the dollar store book bin. A recent one I found is Colin Powell's autobiography. I've been an admirer of his since Desert Storm when CNN made him and other stars (now it seems like cable news just makes people look stupid), and it seems to me the Powell Doctrine – be clear about your objectives and go in with more than enough resources – applies to just about anything.
 I felt like the second Bush administration (i.e. the administration of the second Bush) really screwed him over with the second Gulf war.
This is his first autobiography and ends before
