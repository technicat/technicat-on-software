I’ve been getting notices about an updated ToS from Google Play Books, so I figured I might as well publish my self-published book, Technicat on Software, there.

I’m guessing I signed up for Google Play Books some time ago and didn’t publish for some reason, but this time around it was pretty straightforward: uploaded a file, choose a cover, and specify the pricing and distribution.

Well, the second time around, anyway. The site flagged my first upload for some epub markup it didn’t like, so I reexported my book from Apple Pages and it was fine, except I didn’t see any way to replace the old upload with the new upload and eventually just deleted the first book submission and started from scratch. And then there’s a several-day “account approval” period after hitting the publish button, but now my book is on Google Play Books.

And here’s how it looks when reading on a desktop browser. Also looks fine on my Android phone.

In the process, I added a couple of new chapters to the book, and while I was updating the kindle version, I saw Amazon moved their print-to-order option, formerly available from CreateSpace, in-house.

It’s a simple process: upload the file (in my case an epub), select or provide a cover image, select the book size and price and other distribution details, and before publishing, you can order a draft copy to review (or for others to review). Of course, you have to pay for it.

After checking that the draft copy didn’t look terrible (it could probably use some different fonts, though, and reformatting so that it fits in a smaller book format), I went ahead and published it.

There’s an actual printing cost, about $3, which is why it’s priced a couple of dollars more than the kindle version.
