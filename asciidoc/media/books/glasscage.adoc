= The GlassÂ Cage

The author brings up a lot of interesting points and case studies of how automation can have the opposite of the intended effect, but halfway through, I feel he is belaboring the point without bringing up solutions (he does mention an improved approach to design, but in a manner that suggests there is some kind of entrenched conspiratorial resistance to it). And I felt like asking him, I bet you're using a word processor, and not using a typewriter (like Elmore Leonard) or handwriting the book, and you haven't even turned off the spell checker, right?
