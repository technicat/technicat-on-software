Maybe I’ve been missing out, but I swear the first time I heard the term “optics” used to describe how a political situation looks was just in the last few years, and I thought oh great, some political operative is getting fancy with the words. But now I hear it all the time.

I don’t want to sound like a fuddy-duddy with language (although I’m still getting used to “woke” and “shook”), but it’s like someone took the name of a venerable branch of science (Newton wrote a book called Opticks — remember him?) responsible for everything from lasers to eyeglasses and decided to make an idiot’s version of it.

This feels like a case of cultural appropriation, like how people say “exponentially” to mean “a lot.” There’s still a lot of nerd-bashing these days, and complaining about STEM, but it doesn’t stop them from stealing our words. YourDictionary.com even lists the thousands-years-old science version as the secondary meaning.

Maybe we should just give up and rename the study of light “opticks.”
