I’ve found a magazine feature that annoys me more than the Forbes 30 Under 30 (or the copycat Inc Magazine 30 Under 30, or Technology Review’s 35 under 35, or UNLV’s 40 under 40…). It’s Luxury Magazine, Las Vegas edition, with their Men of the Moment.

It’s not like the rest of the year is filled with Women of the Week. Every issue is chocked full of wealthy men (and cars that cost more than my condo, and watches that cost more than my car…)

I almost wish they’d do a 30 Under 30 feature, instead.
