When I was preparing to sell my condo in California, the contractor was a Mexican-American and the realtor was a White-American (you know, with ancestors from the Land of White). They actually had a lot in common — both in their seventies, both born and raised in Orange County from parents also born and raised in California.

And while the realtor complained to me when the contractor was tardy “Those people don’t raise their children right,” the contractor told me, after recounting high school stories of white classmates talking inappropriately about their sisters, “Those people don’t raise their children right.”

I don’t really have a point here. I just think it’s hilarious.
