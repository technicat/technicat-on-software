I was going to retweet some breaking news from AP, but I just couldn’t, after seeing more than half the page taken up by these ads:

The Taboola stuff just looks so tawdry. Even the “More from AP” section, which I assume links to real news stories, have a tabloid look. Half of the “Ad Content” look like scams. I admit I’m curious about “Why Guys Are Obsessed With This Underwear…” but I’m afraid to click/tap on it, lest I end up seeing that ad everywhere.

I wonder if it bothers the journalists who are trying their best to deliver this breaking news to have their reporting embedded in a bad ad sandwich. And the designers who maybe spent six months arguing in meetings about the right font to use might as well have used Comic Sans. It makes me nostalgic for the text-only web.
