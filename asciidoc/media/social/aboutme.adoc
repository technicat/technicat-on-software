One reason I will never change my name is because I have the domain name for it. I haven’t been paying attention to it for a while, so it’s been pointing who-knows-where, but now I’ve got it pointing back to my about.me page.

I haven’t been paying much attention to about.me, lately, either, while it seemed to be going through some contortions in an attempt be some kind of social network, but now that I look at it again, it seems to me they’ve settled down and focused on just being a good-looking personal landing page and providing an easy way to link to your other social networks (my favorite feature).

As an update, I added some more of those social network links (they support Medium, now!) and replaced the featured image. Previously, I had this cool Hubble repair mission poster flown on the shuttle, but people kept asking if it was real or if I’d photoshopped it.
