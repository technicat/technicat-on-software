I got some spam from an app only-nice-reviews seller, and I have to admit their web site is polished, so maybe it’s a thriving business.

Their web site even has a testimonials page. Which leads me to the question of why you would trust testimonials for a service that sells only-positive reviews (and also why you’d post a review confessing that you buy positive reviews).

And in fact Trustpilot is a site where companies sign up (and pay) to receive “trusted” reviews, which filter out at least some of the negative ones. I know, because I posted a review there that was removed at the company’s request. I complained about spam.
