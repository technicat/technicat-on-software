That’s It, Jack?

Yesterday, @jack asked for the highest impact way to help with the family separations going on at the border. And this is the result.

Now, I’m not the most politically active person, and I’m not a fan of lecturing others on how they could do more (it’s annoying), and he probably donated more than I’ll ever make. But he did say “everything it takes” and “highest impact”, so my reaction was, “That’s it?”

@jack did get a lot of suggestions in response to his tweet (not all polite), and mine was to say something on the official @twitter account, which at the moment is kind of a waste of 63 million followers. It only tweets about once a week (although sometimes several times on that day — it’s like it was assigned as someone’s Google Friday project). The tweets do include some public interest topics, e.g. this month there were several about Pride Month, and last month on World Press Freedom Day, and the previous month on Equal Pay Day… so I guess this month’s topic is already taken.

But in retrospect, I think I may have misinterpreted @jack’s tweet. I thought he was asking for recommendations on the highest impact way for him to do everything he could on this issue. Now I’m thinking he was asking (almost rhetorically) about something that all of us could be doing. Fair question, but kind of a letdown. I got all excited about the vision of a charismatic tech billionaire swinging into action and wielding his brash influence in the cause of justice. But in reality, while everyone wants to be Tony Stark, they rarely try to be Iron Man.
