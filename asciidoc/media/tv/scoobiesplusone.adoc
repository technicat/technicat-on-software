Scoobies +1
At WonderCon (Wonder Con? Wondercon?), I was standing in line for a talk on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, said stretch consisting mostly of teenage girls, as someone walked down the handing out flyers to WhedonCon (Whedon Con? Whedoncon?). She glanced at me and passed by without giving me a flyer, so like an airline passenger flying coach who almost didn't get his bag of peanuts, I had to catch her attention and get the pass back.
Now, I watched Buffy way back when it premiered and had to insist, before it was established that Joss-Whedon-is-a-genius-and-Buffy-is-a-feminist-masterpiece-or-at-least-does-a-pretty-good-job-of-telling-the-story-of-a-high-school-girl (notwithstanding the one chapter I read in an otherwise Whedon-worshipping book of Buffy essays that basically said "What's so feminist about Buffy, and I don't even think the humor is funny"), to women telling me "Oh, of course you like that show" that no, really, it's a great show. And then Angel (apparently not everyone liked the first season, but I enjoyed it, and each season got better and better). And then Firefly (when I first saw it on TV I thought this show is probably pretty good if I hadn't skipped some episodes, and then on watching the DVD realized it was Fox who had removed and rearranged some episodes). Dollhouse wasn't exactly a dud, but I didn't really get into it until the second season, which I liked a lot more.
For a while, I assumed the secret sauce was the Scooby gang. The characters in Buffy sometimes even referenced the group of protagonists as the Scooby gang or Scoobies (I don't remember exactly which – I'll have to rewatch the series for the umpteenth time to clarify). That's why the first season of Dollhouse fell flat for me – it seemed like it was all about the main protagonist and her adventure of the week. Pretty much like most TV series. Whereas in Buffy, Angel and Firefly, and the second season of Dollhouse, it's all about the team. The hero might not even be your favorite character.
But recently, I thought about it a little more (perhaps while I was standing in line at Wondercon), and realized, it's a bit more than that. What raises the dynamic of Whedon Scoobies over other just mildly-interesting ensemble casts is the addition of the outsider. Not even outsider – a former enemy.
Angel, the dark, brooding vampire cursed with a soul, doesn't quite fit the bill, at least at first, as he starts out as an ally of the Scoobies, who just formed, anyway. He's only perceived as a threat by some through misunderstanding (Kendra) or Xander (jealousy). He does turn evil (long story), and then back (longer story), so there is a period of reintegration into Scooby society.
A more clear-cut example, and fan favorite, is Spike, who finds himself helping out his mortal enemies more and more. Another is Anya, former demon now failing math. And less obvious, Cordelia, human mean girl.
In Angel, the Scooby gang absorbed a series of outsiders  – such as Fred, the delightfully quirky physicist rescued from another dimension, Lorne, the green lounge lizard with a velvet voice and visions, and Charles Gunn, demon hunter from the 'hood (Whedon's Los Angeles is a typical Hollywood white LA where minorities are in the 'hood, Mexicans are mask-wearing wrestlers, and Asians are in Chinatown, except they're also demons, and there's the hot Asian from another dimension, and there's Daniel Dae Kim as a lawyer from the evil law firm, so that was good).
But the story (arc) was driven forward by nemeses drawn into the fold. Darla, former significant other in Angel and the first(?) vampire to appear in Buffy, makes a reapparance that ends redemptively. Faith, a fallen vampire hunter and also Buffy nemesis, is emotionally and morally rescued by Angel. His son Connor grows up with a lot of Daddy issues but
