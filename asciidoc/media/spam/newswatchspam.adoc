NewsWatch Spam

This email has all the hallmarks of spam: the “Hi there” salutation, the “one of our producers found you” likely story (I don’t know why that’s a common line, but it is), and the utter absence of any indication they know anything about my business or products.

Also, it was sent to my Google Play email address, which is only used by app store harvesting spammers and the occasional irate customer. Still, I’m a sucker, and occasionally I respond on the off chance it’s legit, and I always regret it, but wow, it’d be great to get some TV exposure!

But thank Google, I don’t have to wonder, as others have inquired. I especially enjoyed the lengthy defense by NewsWatch explaining how they’re family-owned multiple times (it’s family fraud, not corporate fraud!) and their pitch isn’t misleading because the email contact has Sales in his title (actually Sales and Content).

Well, fraud or misleading or not, it’s still spam, and it’s not must-see TV.
