A Localization Too Far

One mistake I keep finding in my app localizations is that company names get translated. This happens sometimes when my friends contribute translations, and it’s happened a lot with Google Translate (which I used with the M2H Localization Package)

For example, I was just looking at the Chinese translation I have for “HyperBowl is a trademark of Hyper Entertainment, Plc.” and I ran it back through Google Translate.

Fortunately, Google Translate is always getting better. When I tried the original translation again, but updated to the new corporate identity for Hyper Entertainment, it looks better.

At least, the company name didn’t get translated, and the translation looks plausible. As soon as I learn Chinese, I’ll know for sure.
