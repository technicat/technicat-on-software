The Other SDCC

I’ve been to at least six consecutive San Diego Comic Cons, but I’m going to break my streak this year, partly out of fiscal prudence (it’s a lot cheaper to visit San Diego every other day of the year), partly because they switched me from Creative Pro to Trade Pro (the implication being that I have to pay for a badge and that I’m no longer creative), and every year I spend less time at the con because it’s getting more crowded (or maybe I’m just getting more allergic to crowds).

The one thing I will really miss, though, and where I’ve been spending more time during each Comic Con, is the San Diego Cat Cafe. It’s like an anti-con, a short walk from the convention center, but it’s quiet time with the kitties. This SDCC (get it?) does get busy during the con like everything else in downtown San Diego, so they take reservations.

I recommend the early hours: they’re less crowded and you can start off your day with the coffee that comes with the reservation (I always get a pastry, too) and get in the right mood with some cat time. Don’t be put off by the $20 reservation fee: it goes to a good cause, keeping all those cats housed and fed (until they get adopted), and it’s a drop in the bucket for a Comic Con trip.
