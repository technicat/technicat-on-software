= The Vegas Valley Comic Book Festival

If you find the big Comic Con in San Diego too much of a…well, just too much, then perhaps you’d enjoy the cozy one-day Vegas Valley Comic Book Festival held by the Clark County Library here in Las Vegas. It’s free and family-friendly, with food trucks and booths manned by local comic vendors.

Of course they have an Artists Alley.

With some well-known creators such as Gene Ha.

And my sister, Amy Chu, is a regular there.

And you can always take a break and check out the library. It’s a lovely building.
