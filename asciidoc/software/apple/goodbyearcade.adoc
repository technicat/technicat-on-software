It’s not earth-shattering news, but I received notification that Apple’s changing the Arcade subcategory of the Games category in the App Store to Casual.

If there’s big news here, it’s the impending Apple Arcade service. But I’ve got some questions, though. Like, do they really think people will somehow confuse the Arcade subcategory of Games on the App Store with the Apple Arcade service? How would that happen? Is this just an excuse to remind everyone about the Apple Arcade service? (I did forget)

What happens when everyone starts putting “arcade” as a tag for their formerly Arcade apps? Rejection time? And how is Casual equivalent to Arcade? I don’t remember plugging quarters into a Farmville machine.

Also, I feel a mite uncomfortable being described as a “part of the Apple ecosystem.” I suppose it’s better than “cog in the Apple machine” or “serf on the Apple feudal estate.”
