If You Love Something, Name It Free. Unless It’s an App.

I don’t know if there was a policy change, but my Fugu Maze Free app, which I updated successfully last week, was just rejected as violating this rule (which for some reason is under the Performance section of the App Store Review Guidelines):

    App names must be limited to 30 characters and should not include prices, terms, or descriptions that are not the name of the app.

So, apparently you can’t have “Free” in the app title.

By the way, the line following the one above is:

    App subtitles are a great way to provide additional context for your app

I have no idea what an app subtitle is.

In any case, I can’t think of a different name for Fugu Maze Free, and I don’t want to rename it to Fugu Maze and delete the original Fugu Maze (which was originally free until I started charging for it, then people stopped downloading it, so I made a separate free version because I didn’t want to screw over the people who paid for it…), so I’m retiring Fugu Maze Free.

I’m setting you free, Fugu Maze Free. Thanks for all the downloads.
