Xcode Made a Liar Out of Me

I was wondering how my HyperBowl app recently and suddenly crossed the 100MB cellular download limit on the App Store.

But then an Xcode minor release (patch) appeared with a note saying that it fixes an issue (bug) which produces archives larger than necessary (bloated).

I was so confident that rebuilding with this new Xcode would slim down HyperBowl, especially since I didn’t receive the normal iTunesConect email warning you get about exceeding the 100MB cellular limit, that I put “Smaller app size” in the release notes. But actually, and embarassingly, the size remains the same at 138MB in the update listing.

And confusingly, it’s even higher at 145MB in the main App Store page when viewed on my iPad.

And even higher at 163MB when viewed from Safari on my Mac.

Right after this update was approved, a new Xcode release showed up. Although the release notes make no mention of reducing build size, you never know.
