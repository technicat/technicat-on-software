At the beginning of the year, GameDevsLikeYou tweeted the question “What are you thankful for?” I mentioned the new Star Wars movie, and open source.

Specifically, I’m impressed and grateful for all the open source available for iOS development. I only discovered CocoaPods late last year and have been browsing it assidously since. Here are the packages in the pod file of one of my apps:

pod ‘SwiftyUserDefaults’pod ‘Locksmith’pod ‘SwiftyJSON’pod ‘JDStatusBarNotification’pod ‘CHTCollectionViewWaterfallLayout’pod ‘SnapKit’pod ‘FBSDKMessengerShareKit’pod ‘FBSDKCoreKit’pod ‘FBSDKLoginKit’pod ‘FBSDKShareKit’pod ‘CGRectExtensions’pod ‘IQKeyboardManagerSwift’pod ‘RFKeyboardToolbar’

I won’t bother describing each package — just type the name in the CocoaPods very cool search field and you’ll get the full info (I do wish they had a way to search the full list instead of relying solely on the search field).

And CocoaPods is open source, of course. And Cocoapods is installed with the open source RubyGems. As is Ruby. And don’t get me started on what went into OSX.
