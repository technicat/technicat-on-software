Fun With Recruiters

One of my regrets (I don’t understand people who say they have no regrests — I don’t trust them, either) is all the time I wasted responding to recruiter spam, but one time a recruiter got so unprofessional it was entertaining (and he was VP of his recruiting firm, but who knows, maybe there were just two people) — he went on a chain of email tirades, first after I said never mind, I’m not interested (I just didn’t want to argue about why my resume was not in Word and didn’t feel like explaining how to cut-and-paste), and then this after I said “please take me off your email list.”

    I don’t understand, are you being angry because I asked for a resume? What did I do wrong? You’re trying to make me regret asking you for a word version. Everyone does that. You’re being a jerk and not willing to compromise. I don’t get what your problem is. You’re being rude. You don’t respond that way to a simple request like I did something wrong. You owe me an apology. That was way out of line.

And there was more, until I contacted their web site support and asked how I could stop getting emails from that guy. I think I finally got off their email list.
