On the face of it, this login might look like a nice user interface. But don’t let the icons and multicolored text fool you.

Which characters qualify as special characters? I could guess, but I’m a programmer, and it would still be a guess.

Also, this was my third pass. My first pass resulted in a message that I needed a capital letter. The next pass got me the little nugget of info that a number was also required. This isn’t a user interface, it’s a sending in the same form over and over and getting rejected by a bureaucrat for a different reason each time (much like my experience with State of California corporations paperwork and Apple’s app review).

The best login screens display all the requirements right at the beginning (and as a bonus, automatically check them off one by one as you type in your password).
