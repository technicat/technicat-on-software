There was a brief power outage today, and. while I was waiting for my home office to reboot, I surveyed all the clocks I have to reset, like a starship commander assessing battle damage.

Unless, I missed something, I have only two clocks requiring attention. The oven is doing the standard blinking thing.

The microwave, on the other hand, presets a scrolling message: “PLEASE PRESS CLOCK BUTTON.”

The microwave message is certainly more pleasant than the blinking oven text. Maybe too pleasant, as I feel no pressing urge to press the clock button like it says.

And that’s partly because “press the clock button” is rather obvious — it’s what happens after you press the clock button that gets complicated.

The blinking time on the oven, on the other hand, is annoying enough to make me set the time, any time. In the meantime, it still presents useful information. The power outage was only for a few seconds, so the time this time is still the current time. If it had been a longer power outage, the discrepancy would tell me how long it was out, which I just like to know if I’m out and I return to blinking appliances.

But I suppose eventually I’ll have a kitchen filled with Internet-connected (and AI-controlled) appliances, and then this won’t be an issue. And if they require attention, I expect they’ll just talk to me.
