Should the Cancel button be on the left or right of a confirm dialog? Seems like an simple issue, but make an inconsistent choice and you’ve degraded the user experience. For example, I tapped on a tumblr link in the Facebook iOS app and then tapped Open on the tumblr web page:

I tapped the right button on the dialog to open the app and was presented with another confirm dialog that had the cancel button on the right, which I reflexively tapped. Now what I wanted.
