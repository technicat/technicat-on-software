I’ve been contacted by Amazon recruiters before, but this is the first time I recall seeing this paragraph. They could have just said “Don’t believe the New York Times article.”

    Amazon is constantly raising the bar in terms of innovation — it’s a place where builders can truly build. We work hard, innovate and collaborate and we also have high integrity, accountability and transparency. Respect and understanding along with compassion and empathy for a strong work/life balance are core values at Amazon. We aim to hire the brightest and smartest, but who are nice and like to have fun too! Exceptional talent produce exceptional outcomes.
