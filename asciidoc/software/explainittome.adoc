Explain It To Me So I Can Understand

One thing I’ve never enjoyed is dealing with a client’s lawyers, and one of those things I never enjoyed was receiving revised contracts with no mention of what’s been revised (in one case, they increased my time commitment without increasing my payment, which is another reason why I’m all about hourly rates).

But Apple does the same thing with their terms of service (terms of services?). I get a popup, page or scroll through dozens of pages, then tap on the lie-to-me button saying I read and understood the whole thing.

One of the recurring phrases in Korean dramas is “Explain it to me so I can understand.” That applies to so many situations, including this one. And perhaps a variation, “Explain all the changes to me so I don’t have to google for someone else who figured it out.”

But there are some good corporate citizens out there. Like Atlassian, who emailed an advance notice of their policy changes and also explained them (there’s a similar summary of changes for Trello).

Go TEAM! (That’s their stock symbol).
