Over ten years ago, I more or less started blogging/essaying with Seven Habits of Highly Effective Programmers. It’s probably still my most-read essay (when it started getting traffic, I thought my Wordpress site was under attack), and got some nice reviews from Jeff Atwood of StackOverflow fame and Agile leader James Shore.

In the meantime, I haven’t been the only one to riff off Steven Covey’s title (and the one on learntoprogram.tv looks really similar to mine)

It’s nice to see Jeff Atwood’s CodingHorror review still at the top, but the original direct link to my essay is gone because I left Dreamhost after one downtime too many (which I kind of regret after they stepped up, recently) and thus had to relocate all my articles to Medium, but hey, at least now I get claps. And you can buy the book.
