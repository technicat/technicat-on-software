Dim Sum Research

A fun aspect of making a food app is the research. Case in point: to build my Talk Dim Sum app, I visit dim sum restaurants, take pictures of the dishes, and add them to the app.

Unfortunately, outside of the Las Vegas area, it’s hundreds of miles of dim sum wasteland. But while charting a path to the Bay Area, I discovered there are a three dim sum restaurants in Fresno. So I went to two of them. The first was Imperial Garden (conveniently next to the Motel 6 I stayed at), and I ordered three dishes I didn’t have in my app: water chestnut cake, lotus seed steamed bun, and pan-fried shrimp cake.

The next day, before departing Fresno, I got lunch at New City Chinese Cuisine, not too far away. Depicted here is the black sesame mochi and green tea rice ball.

I always like to stop at Gilroy and take a break at the Barnes and Noble or check out the outlet stores (if I had a Tesla, I’d use the supercharger station there), but I found another reason to stop: the Ginger Cafe serves some fancy dim sum, like these cute rabbit custard buns.

Once I arrived in Silicon Valley proper, I intended to check out the Intel Museum, but they were tight on parking (if you want people to visit your corporate museum, provide more parking spots!), but as a consolation prize, I discovered a nearby strip mall with a Chinese supermarket and a restaurant called Ming Tasty with a pretty big menu including dim sum. It’s the first time I’ve seen salmon rice rolls.

My final destination was Millbrae, which has a convenient concentration of dim sum (and other Asian food, mostly Chinese) within a walking distance radius. As soon as I got checked into my hotel, I went to one of my regular places, Cafe Salina, which I didn’t realize now has a comprehensive dim sum menu (I guess I haven’t been there for a while). Some lychee black tea and stir-fried turnip cake with XO sauce made for a nice afternoon snack.

The Kitchen is always packed for dinner (and unfortunately there were some loud brogrammers next to us), but the food is good. Here’s an appetizer platter with crispy skin pork belly, cha siu (BBQ pork), seaweed salad, jellyfish salad, and beef shin.

The Kitchen has the advantage of being centrally located, but if you go down the street a half mile, there’s Zen Peninsula. I happened to be staying in the El Rancho Inn next door, so you can’t get more convenient than that. Here’s another platter.

I think Cafe Salina owes me some complimentary dumplings. After going there by myself, I brought my mom and my brother there, then I brought my mom and brother and dad there, and after posting photos on instagram, some of my cousins and colleagues went there. Tell me you can resist these!
