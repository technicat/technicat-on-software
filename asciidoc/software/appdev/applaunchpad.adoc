I gave AppLaunchpad a try, uploading five HyperBowl screenshots. Five, because AppLaunchpad generates a set of screen-sized iPhone mockup images with captions intended for the App Store (and five is the maximum number of screenshots displayed by the App Store).

In that sense, it is useful, as it generates images for all iPhone screen sizes, although the differing iPhone 4 aspect ratio is a problem, as you can see the bowling ball here is obviously flattened.

Other limitations: I don’t see any support for landscape orientations or iPad screens, and although several color combinations are offered, I still had trouble finding one I liked. Nevertheless, I think it looks good on the HyperBowl (itch.io) page, and I will probably try it on the App Store, at least to generate iPhone 6/7+ sized screenshots.
