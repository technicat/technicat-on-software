There’s plentiful advice on how to write App Store descriptions, but really, with popular apps typically updated every couple of weeks, the action is in the update notes.

Some update notes read like they’re written by the software engineers, in a “Just the fact’s, Ma’am” style. I know, because that’s how I write them. Take the IMDB app, for example:

Some apps look more like they’re written by someone in Marketing. Or an engineer who’s drunk way too much coffee. The Yelp app reminds me of the Trader Joe’s flyers.

Some update notes take the opportunity to engage the user. Meetup presents their changes as rewards for user feedback and asks for more.

In some cases, the app update notes seem to be an excuse to hold a creative writing workshop. Half the time, I don’t know what the Medium release notes are saying. I fully expect to find a screenplay in there one of these days.

But overenthusiasm is better than half-assing it, like LinkedIn, Facebook and Apple. These boilerplate update notes look like they’re written by that minimal-effort engineer who always enters “fixed bugs” in his git commits.

But I guess if you’re a big company, this avoids having a meeting every two weeks to agree on the release notes.
