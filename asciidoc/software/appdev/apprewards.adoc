I’ve been asked what’s the most rewarding part of game development, and I always cite the email I received from a special ed teacher who said the Android version of my HyperBowl game was used as a reward for her student’s attendance in regular classes. That’s still #1.

But this past week (in an otherwise dismal week), I visited some family and discovered my nephew seems to like every iOS game I’ve developed, even choosing them over titles like Monument Valley that I had on my iPad. I like to say no matter what app you make, someone is going to like it, but finding someone who likes every app you make is something else! So this is #2.
