Making animated gifs is one of those things where I’m late to the party, but I was prompted to give it a go by a tweet call for gameplay gifs from gamkedo. For the source, I happened to still have an mp4 of the Tokyo lane in HyperBowl lying around from when I uploaded it to YouTube.

And after googling around and browsing the Mac App Store, it seemed like GIFfun was the easiest way to convert the video to a GIF (although there seem to a number of apps called GIFfun, so I’m not sure I got the one I first heard about).

Anyway, I coughed up a Starbuck coffee’s worth of in-app purchase to activate the video-to-GIF option, and it was easy-peasy after that.
