I’m thinking about making Godot my new game engine, and the first thing I’ve been figuring out is how to build and upload HTML games to itch.io. It’s pretty straightforward, but as usual, there are a few things you have to get right.

First, in your project directory (I’ve been trying this with the demo templates available in the Godot launcher), you’ll need a subdirectory for the build product. On my mac, I’ve been making a “build” folder.

Now you can start the export process, available in the Project menu of the Godot editor.

Click on the Add button of the Export window and select HTML (if this is a fresh install of Godot it’ll prompt you to download the export presets).

HTML will now show up in presets.

Click on Export Project, which brings up the Save window.

You’ll want the build product to show up in the build directory you created instead of mingling with the rest of your project files, and itch.io looks for an index.html file in html games, so rename the save file accordingly.

Click Save, and the new files will show up in your build directory.

Now you can either compress the folder into a zip file and upload it to itch.io, or upload the directory using butler.
