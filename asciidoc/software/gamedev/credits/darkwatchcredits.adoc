There was a discussion of in-game credits on twitter, so (I can’t believe I didn’t do this before), I searched for Darkwatch credits and here they are:

I’m there at the 1:15 mark, next to misspelled Massachusetts. (The problem with getting creative with credits is people get creative, and someone thought it would be cool to have all our birthplaces next to our name)

Seeing the credits there, maybe I have an answer to a minor mystery. My credit started out as “Special thanks” (I was a contractor) and then changed to “Programmer.” I suspect now that it was just easier and looked better to lump me in with the other programmers than create a Special thanks section.
