Converting Javascript, I mean Unityscript, to C# : Part 1

I’m finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel on converting all of my Unity Javascript to C# (I apologize to everyone who bought my Unity book that all the examples were in Javascript). You shouldn’t start this process without reading up on C# (the Microsoft reference is actually pretty good, and I like the O’Reilly books), but for the most part, it’s just a lot of syntax changes. For example, here’s the Javascript used to rock the ship in the High Seas lane of HyperBowl:

#pragma strict
 
 private var speed:float=0.5;
 private var rockness:float=5;
 
 private var rocktime:float = 0.0;
 
 private var trans:Transform;
 
 function Awake() {
   trans = transform;
 }
 
 function Update () {
   trans.localEulerAngles.z = Mathf.Sin(rocktime*speed)*rockness;
   rocktime+=Time.deltaTime;
 }

To convert it to C#:

    Add an explicit class declaration, inheriting from MonoBehaviour
    Remove the var keyword in variable declarations and move the type to that location
    Prepend public to variables that were implicitly public.
    Append f to single-float literals (otherwise, they’re interpreted as double-floats)
    Remove the function keyword from function declarations and place the return type there
    We can’t directly modify a member of a struct, so to change a transform position or rotation, we need to construct a new Vector3.
    Finally, I like to place the whole thing in an appropriate namespace (a great feature, one of the first reasons I started porting to C#)

namespace Hyper {
 
 public class ShipRock : MonoBehaviour {
 
 private float speed=0.5f;
 private float rockness=5f;
 
 private float rocktime = 0.0f;
 
 private Transform trans;
 
 void Awake() {
 trans = transform;
 }
 
 void Update () {
 float z = Mathf.Sin(rocktime*speed)*rockness;
 Vector3 angles = new Vector3(  trans.localEulerAngles.x,trans.localEulerAngles.y, z);
 trans.localEulerAngles = angles;
 rocktime+=Time.deltaTime;
 }
 
 }
 }
