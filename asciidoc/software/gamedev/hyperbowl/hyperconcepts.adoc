My weekend project this weekend is getting the archived videos from Hyper Entertainment (now called Absolute Certainty) organized. When I originally received them, they were on VHS tapes and I paid a local store to transfer them to DVD (for that money, I could have just bought a combo VHS-DVD player that could do the same thing).

Now, considering that my five-year old MacBook Pro doesn’t have a DVD drive, I figured I’d better get those videos off DVD. So I fired up my PC, installed Handbrake to convert the DVDs, and uploaded the videos to the HyperBowl YouTube account (except for a demo video involving the Beatles Yellow Submarine that was immediately blocked by YouTube upon uploading).

Among the videos are some concepts for other “Hyper” games besides HyperBowl.

Here is HyperPool (billiards).

And HyperTilt (pinball).

And HyperDart (darts).
