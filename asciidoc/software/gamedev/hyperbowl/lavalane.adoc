Once nice feature of Facebook is that it supports uploading TIFF images. Which made it really convenient to upload all the old HyperBowl concept renderings to the HyperBowl Facebook page.

It also makes it easier to upload them on other social media by saving them back out from Facebook as JPEG files. Including on Medium. There are a lot, so I’m posting a group at a time.

This selection is of an unimplemented HyperBowl lane with lava (so if it was a playable lane, I’d call it the Lava Lane!).
