I had grand plans to switch from Unity development to Unreal development this year. Then I put Unreal on hold after my new MacBook Air started wheezing while just installing Unreal, and instead I got entranced by the idea of using the open source Godot engine, which I was able to install, but still my Mac gets hot while during Godot dev.

And now I’m getting distracted by the Ren’Py visual novel engine. Good news is it runs fine on my Mac. It’s got some inconveniences, like expecting you to have a single project directory, and some conveniences, like the Build Distributions option that generates a single zip file that I can upload to itch.io and runs out of the box for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

As a test/learning project, I created a sequence of conversations that I’ve had as an Asian American.

It’s not exactly the great American novel, but there’s plenty of material I can add to it.
