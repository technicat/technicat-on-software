= Material Search Flutter Fix

Flutter is still officially in beta, so it’s a bit like the early days of Swift (by early days I mean versions up to Swift 4), where every update involves holding your breath and hoping none of the third-party packages break.

I had a good run until my latest invocation of flutter upgrade, which broke the material_search package because RouteSettings no longer has an isInitialRoute property. Specifically, this affects the search screen in my Talk Dim Sum app.

Usually in this type of situation I wait for someone else to fix it, but that repo hasn’t been updated in a long time. But hey, it’s open source (MIT License — remember, it’s not open source without an open source license!), so fixing it yourself just requires a fork, removal of the offending line, and redirecting the package dependency in pubspec.yaml.

dependencies:
 material_search:
   git: git://github.com/technicat/material_search.git

Now it builds fine, again. Feel free to use my fork!
