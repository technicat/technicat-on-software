= The Home Office

I mostly got the new home office ready for the new year, and it’s a reminder that a key to productivity is desk space.

I’m already running low, as in the hours since I took the above photo, I’ve added a couple of more laptops (Linux and Windows). And there’s a devkit I can’t show. And there are tablets and phones scattered all over the place. And there’s easy access to the TV and attached consoles, which not only means I can have a movie on while I work (I’m marathoning the Harry Potter series at this moment), I can build-and-test TV apps (e.g. on tvOS). And since I live in a small place, I’m right next to the kitchen.

So, who needs WeWork? If you want a meeting, see you at the coffee shop.
