I got a lot of comments about driving my 1994 Celica coupe for nineteen years (I still miss that car), but as I broke out my calculator for tax time, I realize this HP-15C must be about 30 years old (I got it in college, so really, it’s as old as my career).

I had to replace the batteries just now (fortunately, there’s a chain of stores here accurately named Batteries+Bulbs), but that’s only the second time, so these batteries are lasting me about ten years each set.

Honestly, it’s overkill for the mundane calculations I use it for — considering it supports complex numbers and matrices, I should be using it for game development. Or at least game development interview quizzes.

It’ll be a sad day when I have to retire this calculator — like my Celica, this is one of those things they really don’t make like they used to — but at this rate, I’ll retire before it will.
