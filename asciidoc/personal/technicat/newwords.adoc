There has been a bunch of recent articles listing some of the new additions to oxforddictionaires.com, but I haven’t seen a single complete list, even on the Oxford site. So below is a slightly longer list aggregated from a few different articles, including a couple of Oxford blog entries.

The most notable (and perhaps most widely cited) is “awesomesauce”, which doesn’t quite match the zing and ensuing despair for the future of the English language as last year’s “amazeballs”. Although the Oxford site itself is rather tacky-looking, so maybe they’re trying to compete with the Urban Dictionary.

Going with that theory, I suspect a good portion of the words were gathered from a bunch of Gamergate fraternity bros hanging out on reddit (“bruh”, “Social Justice Warrior” and it’s acronym, “beer-o-clock”, “fat-shame”, “redditor”, “subreddit”)

But I welcome “cat cafe” (which goes with the “wine-o-clock” crowd) and “MacGyver” the verb, and it’s about time “barbacoa” and “holodeck” made the list, which maybe means Mexican food and science fiction are getting more respect (although I suspect the latter is due more to Oculus Rift and the VR trend, as evidenced by the example sentence in the definition).
