Today is the 30th anniversary of the Hubble Space Telescope, officially celebrated by the release of a cosmic portrait. Hubble is actually a few years older, as it sat around in storage a few years before launch.

I started working at the Space Telescope Science Institute later that year, and they were scrambling at the time to compensate for the mirror problem using deconvolution.

The mirror was later more effectively fixed by the first servicing mission. Although I had nothing to do with the mission, I got a nice poster with a patch flown aboard the shuttle!

One thing about government work, they give nice awards!
