I don’t know the mystery algorithm, but my recently-published podcast interview with Game Devs Like You is tops (barely) in that collection on iTunes.

My podcast being the most recent might be a factor, but listening from my iPod during an exercycle workout, even I found myself interesting — partly because I don’t recognize my own voice (which is more sibilant than I realized) and the interview was conducted last year, so it was almost new to me.

Besides me, I also particularly enjoyed the interviews with Seanna Musgrave and McFunkypants. But they’re all good — I recommend subscribing to the whole thing. It’s motivational.
