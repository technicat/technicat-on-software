The Medium app on my iPad asked me if I enjoyed reading on Medium and to give feedback. Here’s the feedback:

    I love writing on Medium but the feed is terrible and it’s increasingly more work to scroll down and search for articles from people I actually follow. So mostly I read Medium stories when they’re shared on twitter. I’m sharing this feedback because the app asked me if I enjoyed reading on Medium, and for the most part, I don’t even bother to try.
