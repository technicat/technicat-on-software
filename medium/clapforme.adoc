Clap for Me

One of my pet peeves is Medium writers ending their articles with “If you like this, please give me a clap.” (Maybe I’m paraphrasing, it sounds awful when I say it that way).

My instant reaction every time is of course everyone wants a clap/like/share, so should everyone ask/beg/plea for one every time? Then every post might as well automatically have some boilerplate asking for a clap/like/share.

It’s annoying enough on Facebook, but I’m used to getting annoyed on Facebook. Medium is still new enough to be sullied.

Worse is that animation of a hand crossing the screen. And now I’m thinking, what is the sound of one hand clapping?

But anyway, although I wasn’t seriously suggesting that every article should end with a standard plea for claps, I see Medium really has started displaying this at the end of every article:

And actually, that’s a much more practical approach than railing like me against people’s habits (it doesn’t work against app pirates and drivers who never use their turn signal, either). It reminds me of that oft-told story about instead of trying to force students to walk around the grassy area of a university(?) park, administrators went with the flow, paved over the trodden area in the grass, using that as a guide for new paths. That deserves some applause. And I wouldn’t mind a clap, either (old habits die hard).
