It’s Medium’s Fault

I’ve been grumbling about the prevalence of gratuitous images leading off Medium stories, e.g. an article about writing typically features an image of a typewriter (who writes with a typewriter, anymore?) and the self-help section is full of young and mostly white people contemplating their laptop in a coffee shop or standing on a beach staring meditatively at the horizon.

For example, I’d say here only one image is really specific to the story.

And this set is 0 for 3.

At first I thought it was a combination of herd mentality and narcissism (it is the self-help section after all). But now I realize they’re not all self-photos, more like putting stock wallet photos on your social media profile.

And it turns out this practice is recommended by Medium in their Member Content Guidelines.

    Images count
    Medium posts with one or more quality images relevant to the content perform better both on Medium and when shared on other networks.

    Double-check to make sure you’re not violating copyright or licensing with your images. Free resources like Pexels, Pixabay, and Unsplash are great for sourcing Creative Commons-licensed images.

So they’re saying hey, if you want to make money on your stories, put a stock photo on it, so it’ll fit in with those tabloidy Outbrain/Taboola/Zergnet layouts. And they, by the way, always show young blonde women, just like this sample from Unsplash (the other Medium-recommended image sources are similar).

But I do like this section of the content guidelines.

    Do not ask for claps or include other calls to action, including gifs of clapping, requests for donations, email list sign-ups, or other links or embeds for the purpose of capturing user information or soliciting money.

That’s almost enough for me to start paying for a membership. But not if I have to look at all those stupid photos.
