Medium could probably change fonts without me noticing, but I was startled by this recent change. Since it applies to all previously-written stories, it’s tempting to think I’m going crazy, but you can still see the previous sans-serif titles in story summaries (like on a Profile page).

Maybe it’s A/B testing, maybe it’s here to stay (for a while). For now, I’m just staring at it to see if I warm up to it (still waiting…)
