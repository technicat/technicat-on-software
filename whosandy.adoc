Spam is a fact of life, but someone has to fight the good fight, so sometimes I reply and ask where they got my email address, which usually just gets ignored, but once in a while I get a response saying whoever sent the email is out of the office however rest assured we never buy email lists (they must be really good at guessing email addresses then). And sometimes I just leave a complaining review. But this person didn’t take it well.

    Hello Philip, My name is Ed DeAngelis the CEO of Amerifi, LLC. I am in receipt of the 1 star review you gave us but can not find any record whatsoever of your name in our salesforce system. I am not sure who you were contacted by from my company AMERIFI, so I am requesting you please supply documentation of this email or several emails that you received from Amerifi. We are not a sleazy company in any way and we do not solicit or reach out to anyone unless they are interested in our products. I noticed you are new to Trustpilot which raises a red flag to me that you may possibly have been put up to this by Andy. I am not sure, but I am in process of hiring an attorney to investigate this for me as false accusations are unethical and somewhat illegal. We are a great company and we will do whatever it takes to protect our pristine reputation! I sure hope this can be resolved amicably. Thank you for your time on this matter & have a great day

Hey, if I hired a lawyer for every one-star review I got for my apps, well, I’d stop making apps.
