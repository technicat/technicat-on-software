Diversity in Airbeds

In the four years since I sold my condo and gave most of my stuff to charity or my neighbors (I call it The Purge), I’ve been sticking to the rule that I only buy what will fit in my car (and it’s a small car). Thus, I buy air mattresses.

I recall the first time I checked the selection at Target, I complain-blogged (clogged?) that one of the brands only had white people on their packaging. I don’t remember who it was. It could have been Coleman. But if it was, things have turned around. On this latest air mattress replacement trip (my Serta sprung a leak in less than six months), Aerobed and Serta were all young white couples, while Coleman featured black, white, and possibly an interracial couple, I’m not sure (but points for ambiguity!).

I would have liked an obvious Asian — maybe I’ll see one next time my mattress springs a leak.
