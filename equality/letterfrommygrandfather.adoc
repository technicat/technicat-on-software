I found an old letter from one of my grandfathers, or rather, just the last page, and it’s aged like parchment. But it’s enough to give an idea of the prejudice against Chinese Americans back then, and maybe provide some perspective to those who indulge in the Model Minority view of Asian Americans (and many Asian Americans are among them).
