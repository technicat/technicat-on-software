I got signed up on the LaunchTicker newsletter after a client participated in the Launch Festival, and actually I found it interesting reading. But I unsubscribed after they started including ads, then resubscribed, and now I’ve unsubscribed again after seeing this ad.

It’s so cliche, a VC newsletter with an ad on how to hire millennials. The Bay Area is starting to resemble Logan’s Run (which is not a movie that millennials are likely to have watched, so we’re due for a remake). ProductHunt could be renamed Products by Millennials for Millennials.

At least maybe all the old fogeys who’ve been complaining about outsourcing tech jobs to foreigners (specifically, non-white foreigners) will realize the enemy is within our borders. And in Canada.

Now, if they started showing ads on how to hire and retain women and minorities, I might sign up again.
