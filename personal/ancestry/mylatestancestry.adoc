Every once in a while I check 23andme to see if my ancestry has changed.

For a while, I was little bit Korean, and then not, and now I am again. Southeast Asian became more specifically Vietnamese. Chinese Dai is a new one, and pretty interesting, had to read up on that one.

I’m pleased to say I’m at least in culinary touch with my roots, although I’ve only been to one Mongolian restaurant, and never tried Chinese Dai food.
