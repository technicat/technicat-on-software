The CVS pharmacy at my local Target is starting to look like an Apple Store.

So far, I’ve purchased a smart scale and the 23AndMe test kit. My test results recently arrived. No big surprises in the ancestry report. I’m still Chinese, but with a couple of percent to make things interesting (maybe that 1% Korean accounts for my kdrama addiction).

The wellness report also just tells me what I already knew. Can’t drink milk, don’t turn red from alcohol, couch potato, don’t drink that much coffee, light sleeper.

The traits report states even more of the obvious (dark eyes), but some of that’s good to know ( I can thank my ancestors for little back hair), and there’s some stuff I never knew that I didn’t have, like photonic sneezing (sneezing when going into sunlight — sounds like vampire hayfever).

And the scary report with a list of rare diseases is clean. Still, they should put up a big fat zero in the front page so I don’t have to look through the whole thing. Who needs the suspense?
