Minimal Tweaking

After getting my new GitHub user page up and running, I thought about moving on to some other static site generation system to get a more snazzy look. After all, even the sites showcased by GitHub aren’t using the built-in Jekyll support.

But with just a little tweaking of the Minimal theme, I got something I’m satisfied with, for now.

To fill up the original white space on the left with a logo, I added the logo image file to the repo, made a copy of the defaults.html file from the Minimal repo, add a line to include the logo, add a line for the logo credit, and changed “View my GitHub profile” to “Projects on GitHub”.

Reading the default.html file also helped me figure out how the site variables are used, so I specified the title, description and google_analytics values in the _config.yaml file.

I also made a styles.css file for CSS customization but haven’t added anything there, yet.

You can create your own 404 Not Found page (otherwise you’ll get a GitHub 404 page) by adding a 404.html or 404.md file. I just made a copy of my index.md, so you always get the same web page.

Next step, setting up the custom domain (right now it’s just forwarding).
