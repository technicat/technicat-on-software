To my amusement, the sales office at my condo complex referred to me as a “software tycoon” when they profiled me a few months ago via a sponsored content feature in the local paper.

There actually is a software tycoon here: Tony Hsieh founded Zappos and poured a lot of money into revitalizing downtown Las Vegas where Zappos is based. And I hear he also owns a high-rise condo unit here (actually several). We do have something in common!

So I expected a search for “Las Vegas software tycoon” to show Tony at number one and me somewhere down the list (I don’t know how many other software tycoons are here). But it’s just me.

Although I did hear that someone saw that profile about me and called the sales office identifying himself as another software tycoon. So I guess the headline worked. And us software tycoons should get together, maybe form a club.
