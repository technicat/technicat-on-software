I know I complain about the standard gratuitous serious-selfie photos that preface many a Medium story (it’s as if there’s a template with space for a photo at the beginning and a plead for claps at the end), but according to a promo interview I gave for my condo sales office, I’m a software tycoon!

Anyway, I don’t look serious in the photo because I was instructed to smile and lean naturally (so I felt like a grimacing pretzel). And I managed to sneak in a HyperBowl plug!
