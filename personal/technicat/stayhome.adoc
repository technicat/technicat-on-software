The state and our governor has been consistently on message with Stay Home for Nevada, but like a recalcitrant child the city is constantly exhorting everyone to go out.

I agree it’s important to get some sunshine and fresh air and exercise, and these tweets include some safe distancing reminders, but they only started mentioning the safety tips well into a month of the business shutdown and stay at home directive. In the meantime the mayor, who downplayed the pandemic risk and balked at the shutdown, is filming her messages with a film crew standing on Main Street, and the city social media looks like a teenager who just wants to party again.

The latest breaking news is that we can get our drink on. At last, an indoor activity!

The city seems to be in constant tourism promotion mode and just waiting for the pandemic to pass so we can get back to business as usual, which is a problem if we have to adjust to a new era in which we can’t rely on packing people from around the country into entertainment venues as our main business engine. That didn’t work out the last recession, either.

Also, we’re more than “What Happens in Vegas, Stays in Vegas.” We have an art scene (not just the First Friday monthly “art festival” which is another big party), a literary scene (some of it colocated with a fantastic indie bookstore), an excellent public library system, a local music scene separate from the headliners on the Strip, a new medical school (which has turned out to be a lot more useful these days than the football team the city and local business knocked themselves out to get), even a bit of tech here (despite the low-ranked school system).

Let’s show we’re not just a pretty face and this city isn’t just full of people who’ve never cracked open a book and only know how to occupy themselves with biking and drinking.
