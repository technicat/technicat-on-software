The latest step in my social media cleansing is removing all the reviews I made on Google Maps. Whenever google emailed me to report high viewership stats on my reviews, I’d think why am I doing this for free?

But the last straw was when I did my occasional google privacy settings check and found I was opted in (as in someone opted me in but I don’t remember it being me, very facebookish of them) to “shared endorsements” which apparently shows your favorable reviews in ads.

So I turned off sharing (this setting is in “People and Sharing” not privacy settings), but I also deleted all my google reviews, one by one as I didn’t see any way to remove all of them at once.

That’s pretty tedious so it’s another reason why if I write any more reviews (I do like to give new establishments a boost and my review-complaint against the crossfit gym in my building did get them to tone down the noise a bit), I’ll only keep a few active at a time. Get your google review, limited time only!
