I often complain about Apple’s app reviewers, but at least they’re obviously human (although I suppose it wouldn’t be difficult to implement a bot that sniffs “I can’t tell you exactly what to change, but this app just isn’t good enough”).

Google, on the other hand, if they have humans rejecting on Google Play, they’re doing their best to look like bots, as with this recent notice of app removal I got from them.
