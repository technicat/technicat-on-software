Thanks for Listening

A while ago, I read and commented on an article supporting the manifesto from that google guy. I pointed out the fallacy in saying look, he‘s not racist because he said he’s not racist. The article‘s author responded ha ha, fair point, repeated everything he said before, and signed off with “Thanks for listening.”

And that’s when I knew I’d just been suckered into wasting my time. “Thanks for listening” is what my racist elderly neighbors in Orange County would say after talking about the good old days and complaining about Mexicans. It’s a way of saying, see, I’m a nice person, so what I just spent twenty minutes going on about can’t be that offensive. It says you’re a nice, open-minded person and you did the right thing spending that twenty minutes listening to my crap instead of objecting or walking away five minutes in. It says I don’t have a closing argument, and I don’t need one, because all that tortuous logic I just went through would sound stupid when summarized. It says this wasn’t really a discussion where I was interested in other viewpoints, it’s just me talking and you listening. It’s a kindler, gentler version of “I’m not politically correct. I’m just telling it like it is.” It says we’re still friends, right? And it says, come on back, because I’ve got more of this stuff.

Thanks for listening.
