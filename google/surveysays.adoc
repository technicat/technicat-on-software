It’s nice to see a link to a “how are we doing” survey, but sometimes, like with those little customer satisfaction cards in restaurants, you suspect they really don’t want to hear it. With Google Play, it’s more than a suspicion: when I clicked on the feedback link from my most recent Google Play rejection, it said I’d already answered the survey (from a previous rejection), but I could edit the previous one. On the other hand, it turns out my new feedback would have been pretty much the same as the previous, so maybe the one feedback fits all rejections model does work. Efficiency!
