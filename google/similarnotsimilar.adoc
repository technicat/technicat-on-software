Similar, Not Similar

I recently checked the Google Play page for HyperBowl, and whatever algorithm or AI they’re using to show “similar” apps, it’s not working.

If you like this bowling game, surely you’ll enjoy this Indian taxi app and this South Carolina newspaper!

The only thing in common these apps have is that they’re apps. Maybe there are a bunch of people playing HyperBowl while riding taxis in Chennai or reading the paper in Myrtle Beach. Or maybe there’s some paid app promotion I’m not aware of, like how searching for “dim sum” in Yelp will return a paid listing for a hot dog place at top.

But I don’t mind if they’re not showing other bowling games. Less competition for me, after all.
