I hate Aptoide because they’re a pirate site pretending to be a developer site (I mean, c’mon, they have a feature that automatically copies the Google Play description of that app that you pirated, er, developed), they required me to register an account just to report pirated versions of my apps, that didn’t do any good, and I couldn’t get rid of my account. Which led to a recent email (pirate newsletter!) with this footnote:

    This message is sent to people that registered at Aptoide and cannot be considered SPAM cause the sender is correctly identified.

That’s the type of thing that spammers say. And by “correctly identified”, I guess they mean they have my email address. It’s not like they said “Hey, buddy, long time! How’s Vegas? By the way, here are some apps of dubious origin you might want to download. Wink wink.”

They didn’t even mention my name. These days, I expect some fake personalization in my spam. And they called it SPAM. Which according to Wikipedia is allowable in all caps or lowercase for email and food, but still, it look so alarming. Or like it should be an acronym. Spurious Pirated App Mail? Work with me here.
