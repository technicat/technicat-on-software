I’m pleased to announce my company has won an software and data award, awarded by a company with “wealth”, “finance”, and “international” in its name, so I’m feeling rich, powerful, and worldly.

As part of my acceptance speech, I would like to thank Google for requiring me to list an easily-spammable email address on Google Play. I couldn’t have done it without you guys.
