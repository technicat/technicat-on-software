Years ago, back when the Las Vegas Hilton hosted the Star Trek Experience and was still called the Hilton (now it’s the Westgate, I think), I enrolled in the Hilton HHonors rewards program and three months later unenrolled, after concluding the unsubscribe links on their plentiful spam didn’t work.

I signed up again recently, and had an opportunity to test the unsubscribe link immediately. Fingers crossed, but I can see from the email footnote they haven’t lost their marketing focus:

    Unsubscribing from all marketing email will prevent you from receiving your HHonors Monthly Statement.
