Nothing Says You’re Special Like An Unsubscribe Link

This isn’t the first time I received a recruiting email from this startup.

Although I vaguely recall the first time I wasn’t sure if it was a recruiting email or an invitation to sign up for their service. This time it’s clearly a recruiting email, although the one-minute application process sounds like they’re casting a wide net. Also, the email includes an unsubscribe link, which is much appreciated but confirms it’s a mass email. Another clue: it was sent to one of my email addresses that’s supposed to be private and was probably purchased on some illegal email list.

Of course, I had to check if it looked like a promising company, but I see on on their web site they’re pretty much hiring for all positions, and I see on Angel List they’re only offering equity. I guess they spent all their money on buying email addresses.
