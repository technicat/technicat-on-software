The next insanely great product I’d like to see from Apple is adequate documentation. For example, I was googling for how to stop dark mode in iOS 13 from changing the colors of an app, and found some articles suggesting one option is to set the UIUserInterfaceStyle property in info.plist to Light.

At this point, my practice is to go to the official documentation, so I can fully understand this feature and all its options, but this is the Apple doc:

UIUserInterfaceStyle

This reminds me of the time I asked an engineer in my group to document their code, and the result was a function GetData with a comment “Gets data”.
