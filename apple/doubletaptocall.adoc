Double Tap to Call

My least favorite iPhone feature is the phone. Or Phone, as the app is named. Specifically, how it starts calling as soon as you tap a number. I have to take extra care as I view my Recent Calls not to accidentally call some random recent contact (if I’m lucky, I’ll just call a spammer — karma, baby).

I wonder how many accidental iPhone calls have been made over the years? How many accidental overheard conversations? Does anyone at Apple actually use the iPhone as a phone?

When I do deliberately tap on a contact in a list, I have this insane idea it will just show me the full information on that contact. And double-tap as a shortcut to call would be just fine. And triple-tap to prank call (it’s election season, and the pollsters are getting on my nerves).
