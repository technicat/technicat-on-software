I try to watch a WWDC video every day, and I might be done before the next WWDC starts, but the toughest ones to slog through are the design videos. There’s some good stuff, but a lot of stating the obvious, and some questionable stuff that makes me think they’ve been coasting since the original Mac days.

In fact, there’s one video that begins with the presenter holding pointing to a copy of the classic original Apple Human Interface Guidelines (back when there was just the Mac). I wish I still had my copy.

But then later the presenter admonishes developers from using any recognizable share button like

or this one

because although that may be reasonable, it’s wrong! Use the Apple system action button! Because that’s what Apple users are used to!

But then I just looked at the new App Store on iOS 11 and wondered, hmm, what’s that … button do?

Well, it’s the share button. So is the old action button gone, and this is the new one?

But then I checked the iTunes app on iOS 11 and it seems not all apps got the memo. It’s still got the same old action button.

It’s hard to take them seriously, sometimes.
