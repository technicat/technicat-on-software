I have no idea what the name means or why it’s lowercase, but go90 is my new favorite iPad video app. I found it due to a tweet from Michael J. Straczynski about where to find all of Babylon 5, and pleasant suprise #1) no login required, and pleasant suprise #2) it’s got The Sarah Connor Chronicles!

SCC, if I may be permitted to lazily abbreviate, is one of my top ten favorite shows, maybe top five (competing with three Whedons, a Battlestar, and a show about meth dealers). My criterion for favorite shows is an easy one: how many times I’ve rewatched it, and SCC is up there, even though it’s hard to find (at least, it wasn’t on Hulu last time I checked).

The go90 app is a bit glitchy (sometimes in fullscreen mode I can’t minimize it and have to terminate the app to switch to a different video), but ads aren’t too bad — only encountered one after viewing several episodes. I do wish there was an Apple TV version.
