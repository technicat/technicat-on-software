Now that I’m using Swift, I make a point of trying out any Cocoapod that starts with Swifty. The latest one I found is SwiftyStoreKit, naturally a Swift wrapper around Storekit, Apple’s in-app purchasing API (An IAP API, get it?)

IAP is one of my least favorite areas of app development, and Storekit has got some awkward stuff like overloading SKPaymentQueue.add to both register observers and queue payments.

Here’s what my purchase code in Talk Dim Sum looks like using SwiftyStoreKit, when a user opts to “go pro”:

func buy() {   NetworkActivityIndicatorManager.networkOperationStarted()   SwiftyStoreKit.purchaseProduct(IAP.pro, atomically: true) { result in   NetworkActivityIndicatorManager.networkOperationFinished()   switch result {      case .success(let purchase):       if (purchase.productId == IAP.pro) {        setPro()        }        if purchase.needsFinishTransaction {            SwiftyStoreKit.finishTransaction(purchase.transaction)         }       case .error(let error):          switch error.code {            case .unknown: SwiftyBeaver.info(“Unknown error. Please contact support”)            case .clientInvalid: SwiftyBeaver.info(“Not allowed to make the payment”)case .paymentCancelled: SwiftyBeaver.info(“Payment cancelled”)            case .paymentInvalid: SwiftyBeaver.info(“The purchase identifier was invalid”)            case .paymentNotAllowed: SwiftyBeaver.info(“The device is not allowed to make the payment”)            case .storeProductNotAvailable: SwiftyBeaver.info(“The product is not available in the current storefront”)            case .cloudServicePermissionDenied: SwiftyBeaver.info(“Access to cloud service information is not allowed”)            case .cloudServiceNetworkConnectionFailed: SwiftyBeaver.info(“Could not connect to the network”)            case .cloudServiceRevoked: SwiftyBeaver.info(“User has revoked permission to use this cloud service”)}}}}

Pretty simple, and half the code is just logging reasons why the purchase didn’t complete. And as you can see, the logging is performed by another Swifty package, SwiftyBeaver.
