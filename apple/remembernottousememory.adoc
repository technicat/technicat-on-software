Each new App Store feature is a new way to get your app rejected. I’ve started filling out the new app subtitle field that will show up in the iOS 11 App Store, and as a result Fugu Match was rejected the other day because I had “Test your memory!” as the subtitle and the word “memory” is trademarked by a German company (it would be nice if Apple would just say “it’s in the subtitle”).

This, apparently is old news, and maybe they just started enforcing it, as “Test your memory!” didn’t get flagged in my previous update. In any case, I changed it.

I hope no one has trademarked “remember.”
