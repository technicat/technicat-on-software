In-App Reviews

With iOS 10.3, Apple introduced a new function that provides an in-app rate-this-app interface. Just add a call to SKStoreReviewController.requestReview (Xcode will offer to throw in an available wrapper) and you’ll need to import StoreKit:

if #available(iOS 10.3, *) {SKStoreReviewController.requestReview()} else {// Fallback on earlier versions

In my Talk Dim Sum app, I invoked it from a Rate This App menu option, and this is how it looks.

While you’re testing, this is as far as it gets, but once it’s released, the Submit button works, and it offers the option of also writing a review (the OK button is ambiguous, but I suppose it’s better than “No, I don’t want to write a review”).

One problem with using it this way is that, as I understand it, Apple intends this as a replacement for the commonplace intermittent please-rate-this-app popups, and so, according to the documentation, the popup may or may not appear, depending on “App Store policy”, and you shouldn’t invoke it from a button or menu item, like I’m doing. And indeed, after invoking it a few times, it did stop appearing.

But really, I’m not interested in periodically nagging users to rate this app — it would be nice to reliably bring up this interface, or at the very least have a return value indicating it was unable to appear, so I can fall back to the previous behavior (bringing up the App Store via a deep link).
