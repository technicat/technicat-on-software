“Why can’t you write code without any bugs to start with?” asked one of my managers. Well, why can’t you run this company perfectly, I didn’t answer.

Anyway, bugs are a fact of life, so when you encounter a bug that’s not life-threatening or terribly inconvenient, consider whether it’s a fun bug. Like mishaps on a sports blooper reel, or outtakes shown at the end of a film. And with the frequent updates that take place these days, you might only get a glimpse of them before they’re fixed.

For example, lately the dock on my iPad has been ignoring the device rotation. And, interestingly, the screenshot feature has been following its lead, so these screenshots are incorrectly rotated.

Besides enjoying the quirkiness, I also derive some satisfaction from knowing that a huge team of highly paid software engineers did this. And they probably have a manager complaining “Why can’t you write code without bugs in it?”
