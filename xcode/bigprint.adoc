My vision has never been that great (I was that kid with the coke-bottle glasses), but it’s incrementally gotten worse over the years, enough so that now I always check out the big print section of the library.

It’s even worse when trying to distinguish the Chinese characters embedded in the JSON files of my dim sum app. So I tweaked the Xcode font preferences.

That did the trick, but Xcode apparently got confused and my code looked like this

So rather than tweak all the individual font options, I figured the most expedient path is to switch to another theme for a comprehensive adjustment, and the theme with “Large” in its name seemed like a good candidate

But that’s really large (Presentation Huge might be a better name), and I’m coding with a small laptop screen, so I tried the non-large presentation theme.

And that’s just about right.
