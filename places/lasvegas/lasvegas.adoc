This weekend I returned to the Las Vegas area from a short visit in California, and even though I’ve only been here a year and a half, when I arrive at the airport, it always feels like I’m coming home.

Maybe it’s because, despite the geographical size and transient workforce and numerous transplants (it seems like half the people I meet also recently moved from California), as the locals told me when I first moved here, there’s a small-town feeling of community.

So the tragedy this weekend has really hit this place hard. When I heard about the shooting from the Mandalay Bay the night after I got back, it seemed unbelievable. Much like 9/11, the magnitude was hard to absorb, the news didn’t seem real, and I still haven’t fully processed it.

But what does feel real is the community response. Within hours, multiple blood drives around the city were set up, and people lined up for hours to donate blood. I stopped by the site near my apartment and even though it day two, they were booked and the staff was setting up more tents for the patiently waiting donors. They had traffic control and a stream of restaurants, ice cream shops, you name it, driving in to provide food, drinks, and snacks, even an on-site taco truck.

They told me to help myself to some food and come back later.

This is not a one-day or two-day thing. They’re booked for at least a good portion of this month.

Helping out and donating blood are ways of coping, and other resources have sprung up around the city, like this pet therapy session at the UNLV library.

Even my apartment management arranged for a grief counselor to be on hand at the property and reserved the club room for that use (and I saw that indeed many residents were there).

When I take my morning walk around the complex, it doesn’t look like anything has changed. But if feels like everything has changed.
