One thing I miss about living in San Diego, besides the weather and Mexican food, was my regular visits to the downtown Cat Café.

I had my hopes pinned and then dashed on a cat cafe that was scheduled to open in downtown Las Vegas this spring, but another one sprung up recently a few miles north, the Rescued Treasures Cat Cafe.

It’s not much of a cafe, barista-wise, as the free coffee or tea that comes with the $10 admission fee comes out of a coffee maker or electric kettle, and the free snacks are what you might get out of a vending machine.

But that’s not the point of going to a cat cafe. The featured attraction is the assortment of adoptable cats roaming around. This cafe is really more like an office (it’s in an office building) with multiple rooms, so you can hang out, sit on a sofa or at a table, and check out the cats (and let them check you out).

I’m not looking to adopt, but it’s nice to hang out with some cats while doing some reading or web surfing (now, this is the kind of coworking office I like), and the admission fee helps keep those cat food bowls filled. And who knows, maybe I’ll have to take one of those cats home!
