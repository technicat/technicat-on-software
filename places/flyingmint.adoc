I skipped WonderCon this year because of a trip to New Jersey, which could be the end of an era for me as I think I’ll skip Comic Con this year, too, but as a consolation prize I tried out Jet Blue Mint. It’s their version of first class, but since they’ve made a big deal for a long time about not having first class, it’s called Mint.

Like first-class, Mint flyers are seated at the front of the plane (which means the bathroom at front is Mint-and-crew-only), and you get extra attentive service and fancy food. Also, bigger TVs and an excellent movie selection (both Blade Runners!)

Mint is actually much better than your typical domestic first class, and even comparable or better than overseas business class. You generally get bigger comfy seats in first class, but with Mint, you get the lie-flat seats that normally you only see on overseas business class (and not even all of those).

Pro tip:if you get a seat in row 2 or 4, you’ll have the row on that side of the airplane to yourself (in the other rows you have a neighbor), and you can seal yourself into your own little cubbyhole.

Of course, idiot traveler that I am, instead of stretching out and trying to get some sleep, I tried to cram in as many movies as I could. 2001 is always rewatchable (so it’s a good thing it’s coming back to theaters)

Good thing they served dessert.

Mint isn’t as expensive as first-class if you buy an unrefundable fare, so I waited until the cheap coach fares were gone and Mint wasn’t that more expensive (not exactly a pro tip, but it’s still an indulgence and I have to rationalize).
