It took nine years, but I finally ran out of my last batch of business cards. That may be a sign I’m not networking enough. Anyway, it gave me an excuse to kill an evening searching business card sites. I wanted to try something different from Vistaprint, which was the original make-your-own-mediocre-card site (I was so disappointed when an employer promised me business cards and gave me a stock set from Vistaprint), so I whipped up this front-and-back design on Overnight Prints.

The web interface works well enough, and they make it easy to place a reorder, but at that point you can’t make any changes to the design or even the card stock (too bad, otherwise I’d try out the rounded corners on the next batch). You can’t even export the design to a file (the above image is from the preview on the web site, hence the red guidelines). So I’ll probably go back to Vistaprint next time.
