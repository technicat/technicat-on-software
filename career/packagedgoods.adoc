I found this photo of my old home office wall, showing most of the games (and one 3D modeler) I’ve worked on up until 2006.

Alas, if I were to decorate the same way again, it wouldn’t look any different. Not because I haven’t worked on anything — I just haven’t worked on anything that was physically packaged. A massively multiplayer virtual world (Blue Mars). iPhone and Android apps, webplayer games, OSX widgets, desktop games distributed on the Mac App Store, GameJolt and itch.io.

I guess I should make a digital wall. Maybe in a virtual world, like this credit I had in Playstation Home.
