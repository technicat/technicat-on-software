Name That Rule

It’s easy to give career advice but not always that easy to maintain discipline and follow your own rules. One technique I find useful is to name rules after the places that inspired them.

For example, I’ve learned to never make assumptions about the renewal of a contract. I call this The Papaya Rule, after the game studio where I asked at the end of the initial contract period, “Do you want me to continue?” and they answered “It’s up to you.” I assumed that meant they would pay me, but when I submitted an invoice three weeks later, I found out “It’s up to you” means “Feel free to work here indefinitely without pay.”

So the next time I had a fixed-term contract, when management made vague comments about continuing, I remembered the Papaya Rule: the contract is not renewed until the client explicitly asks and makes clear they’re going to pay. My colleagues said of course they’ll renew your contract, so I patiently explained to them the origins of the Papaya Rule. A benefit of this naming system is that it comes with explanatory anecdotes.

This doesn’t keep me from making new mistakes and thus new rules. The first app publisher I worked with years ago paid me a small advance, but more recently, I signed on with a publisher who didn’t offer an advance, and I let it go, figuring they seemed to have their act together and it was a safe bet. But they didn’t do any marketing of my app and apparently had a platform strategy change and thus never deployed most of the builds I’d prepared for them. And it took two years and a lot of emails and the cancellation of the contract to get paid.

So, my new rule is always get an advance, and that rule is called the Fingerprint Rule, in honor of that publisher.

I have a bunch of rules that I’ve broken frequently, so naming is a problem in that situation. For example, the never-take-a-paycut-rule would have to be called the MIT-Papaya-izWare-HeavyWater-nxTomo-WordsEye rule. It’s apparent by now I’m not going to stick with that rule. Paradoxically, if I’ve learned a lesson more than once, it seems like I haven’t learned it at all.

But even when I’m a repeat offender, I’m not a total dolt, and the naming rule can still be used ver specifically. Take nxTomo again, for example (I broke a lot of rules for that one). That was a stint in Hong Kong, and they flew me out there but after I got there, they said they couldn’t afford to pay for the flight back. So, I may not apply this rule to others, but the nxTomo Rule says if they ever want me out there again, they have to pay me something in advance and I’ll make my own travel plans. Besides, I prefer to fly business class.
