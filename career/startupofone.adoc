A Startup of One

One-person startups get no glory, unless they make Minecraft. Silicon Valley would be half the show it is if Pied Piper was jsut a one-person company.

But if you’re not burning with the desire to go IPO and conquer the world, a one-person company might just be for you.

For one thing, meetings are short. I do sort of have scrum meetings with myself: “What will I do, today?” I ask myself in the morning, and “What did I do, today,” I ask myself in the evening. But that’s it. I don’t let the meetings run too long.

Employees expressed by me are also those of my employer. Enjoy my twitter feed.

I don’t have to ask permission for a vacation.

Or to leave the office early.

I don’t have to maintain core overlapping office hours, unless I have to Skype clients (that last three-way Skype meeting between Hong Kong, California and Budapest was painful). Which is one reason I don’t Skype.

No creative differences.

No communication problems.

Everyone’s on the same page strategy-wise.

I don’t have to worry if someone is getting paid more than me (or at all).

If it doesn’t work out and I need to find a real job, I can fire myself without feeling bad. And write myself a glowing recommendation.
