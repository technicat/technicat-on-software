I was a big fan of Elon Musk the blunt-talking, hard-charging, idealistic clean energy and space travel visionary. Elon Musk the here-to-help-please-don’t-mess-with-my-Mars-project-it’ll-produce-jobs-did-I-mention-jobs? businessman is not so inspirational.

What happened to the guy who publicly labelled a critic a “douchebag” ? I mean, if anyone should be called a douchebag….Does this mean Jeff Bezos is my new Trump-defying space visionary hero?
