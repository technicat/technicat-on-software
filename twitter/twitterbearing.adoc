I checked out my twitter analytics on Social Bearing, and here are the results based on my last 999 tweets, during the last 29 days.

I’m pleased to see I have more positive tweets than negative, although it averages pretty close to neutral.

Most are retweets, so I’m lazy that way. I mostly tweet from my iPad, and the rest mostly from my Android phone (when I go out).

Most of the content I share is from NPR, largely because most of the other news pages I read have those tacky Outbrain/Taboola/Zergnet ads (why don’t I see designers complain about those?).

I tweet around 20–30 times a day, which is maybe a couple of tweets per waking hour, and that’s less than I thought.

Hashtags are mostly work-related, while the word cloud is a word soup with a trump fly in it. Waiter!
