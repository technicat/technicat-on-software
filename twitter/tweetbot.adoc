Notwithstanding their appeal for help with reducing online toxicity, Twitter operates like the Jerry Springer show in setting people up to brawl (in undignified, hair-pulling fashion) in front of an audience for their entertainment. Or maybe more like instigators of a barfight that drags others in.

For example, today I saw a tweet from Sean Hannity in my feed, even though I’m not following him. I was seeing that tweet because some accounts I follow, like NPR, follow Sean Hannity, and some genius at twitter decided by the transitivity of follow, that means I must want to see Sean Hannity’s tweets. Of course, I don’t, so I blocked him, as that is twitter’s only useful filtering tool.

And then after that, I almost ended up arguing with someone I don’t know because they hijacked a thread that spawned from a tweet that someone I followed had liked…anyway, I blocked them. But this minor satisfaction is time-consuming and reminds me of my college days in Boston trying to keep roaches from taking over my dorm room.

But also today (busy day), I saw a tweet about tweetbot and its superior filtering options. I decided it was worth five bucks to satisfy my curiosity at least (a ticket to watch a bad movie costs more).

My first reaction to tweetbot is the problem I’ve had with every other twitter alternative I’ve tried — the official twitter app just looks and feels better. But, like every time I have to get new glasses, I’m getting used to tweetbot over time, and I see its advantages.

First of all, the feed is actually the feed I want to see. It shows tweets of people and orgs I follow, and that’s it. Not what they liked, or tweets from people they follow, and no ads (oh, where will I get my AI-chosen wine and cheese assortment?).

My feed is so much less cluttered now, I’m actually thinking I should follow more people. So twitter, your Facebook-like tactic of cramming content I don’t want to see in my feed in order to increase “engagement” was counterproductive!

Twitter has a cleaner look, but tweetbot does make better use of the iPad screen, e.g. optionally displaying notifications (Activity) alongside the feed, and you can choose to display images at thumbnail size if you want to see more tweets (but then it looks a bit tabular for my taste).

Liking and retweeting on tweetbot takes an extra tap, but maybe that’s a good thing, as I’ve gotten bit like-happy on twitter lately, when liking a tweet takes barely more effort than breathing on the screen.

So, I think I’ll stick with tweetbot, and not just because I spent five bucks on it. I’ve even removed twitter from my iPad. Now, that’s a commitment.
