Dramatic Tweets

When Twitter doubled the maximum tweet limit from 140 to 280, I felt it was taking the challenge out of composing pithy tweets. Now I’m used to the new length, and as with my disk drive and condo, manage to fill up all available space.

But still, the longer limit has led to gratuitous expressiveness. Such as all the tweets that begin with “Your daily reminder…’ (No one likes to be lectured). And NPR is overly fond of the dramatic paragraph break, where each paragraph is a single sentence.

But their tweets used to be more clickbaity, of the you’ll-never-guess-what-happens-next variety, so I guess if the tweet contains more information now, I’ll take it, extra spacing and all.
