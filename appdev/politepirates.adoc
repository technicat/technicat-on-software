These people uploaded HyperBowl from Google Play to their site, but they were really polite about it. They contacted me so I could set up an account with them and asked me to link to them (not that they bothered to link to me).

Well, it’s better than pirating my app and not telling me about it, but this is not a stellar proposition: having to maintain and update another Android app store, taking downloads stats away from Google Play, and this store seems to be filled with user reviews complaining about these free apps having ads on them. I already get that on Google Play.

Besides, I don’t want to reward this type of sketchy business practice by signing up on their site. The only reason I would do that is to remove my app.
