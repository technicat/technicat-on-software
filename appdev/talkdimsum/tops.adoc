As far as I can tell, just by searching for “dim sum” in the App Store, my Talk Dim Sum app seems to be the top dim sum app there.

Admittedly, it’s not a crowded category. Dim sum is like sushi when sushi was still a novelty in the states. Just search google maps for dim sum, and you can see there are large stretches of dim sum wasteland, including entire states (when I lived in Iowa, we used to drive to Chicago for dim sum, and looks like that situation hasn’t changed). And no, P.F. Chang’s doesn’t count.

Maybe that’s why the maps listing dim sum restaurants are a popular feature in my app. Just as frequent as requests for more dishes, maybe even frequent, are requests from users to add their favorite dim sum restaurants or their local neighborhood to the maps.

Honestly, I originally added maps to the app because I like maps and when Apple rejected some of my previous apps, they often said they’d be OK with it as long as I added maps (specifically Apple Maps, not the Google ones). So I inlude maps as kind of an app insurance policy. But it’s cool that people actually use them.

As I like to say, everything is better with maps. You can quote me on that! (no, don’t quote me on that).
