Like Comic Con, WonderCon is an annual ritual for me (kind of a warmup for Comic Con), having attended almost every year since it moved to Anaheim when I lived in Orange County. I moved to Las Vegas, but I have my Pro registration and a free hotel night courtesy of my hotel rewards program, so drove in from Las Vegas for a day. (pro tip: if you qualify for a pro badge for ComicCon/WonderCon what are you waiting for?)

WonderCon is Comic Con not on steroids, and the mellow surroundings of the Anaheim Convention Center seems just right (as compared to the temporary switch to the LA Convention Center last year). Besides the convenience of having Disneyland next door and the associated bevy of hotels and restaurants, there is a nice courtyard entrance to the convention center where the food trucks set up, which is something you don’t get at Comic Con.

However, I’m wondering if WonderCon is starting to outgrow this venue. Just a couple of years ago I could still get a reasonably priced hotel room by the convention center at the last minute, but now most are booked and the normally cheap Anabelle Hotel was listing for over $300 (that’s ComicCon prices!)

And the normally smoothly running organization was pretty confusing when it came to parking — when I drove to the convention center, I ended up following a series of signs several miles to the Honda Center (here’s where a notification feature in the ComicCon/WonderCon app would have been great), at which point it wasn’t clear which parking lot you were supposed to go to, and the buses were all comandeered Disney buses, so I’m sure the drivers were tired of being asked if they were going to WonderCon (my driver didn’t even answer me).

Still, it’s Orange County and you can get a more reasonably priced hotel just a few miles away, some of which have shuttles to Disneyland. And for me it’s a chance to revisit my old haunts, like grab a coffee and eclair in my old neighborhood at La Petite Baguette:

And then take a sunny, breezy drive down the Pacific Coast Highway with a view of the beach to spruce of the fake flowers for my deceased cats at the Sea Breeze Pet Cemetery, where they’re hanging out with the decorated WWII Marine Corp dog Old Sarge.

Another reason to continue this WonderCon tradition: I always find something new. Confused by the driving directions in Google Maps (not for the first time), I branched onto the wrong freeway and stopped at this kitschy 24-hour donut shop, Mimi’s Donuts and Ice Cream.
