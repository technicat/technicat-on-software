Mother
My current must-see kdrama is Mother, a Korean remake of an acclaimed Japanese series (there's also a Turkish remake).
Perhaps because it's a remake, this show is an atypical kdrama. It is standard fare to show in Korean series uncomfortable topics like domestic violence, child abuse and neglect, gambling addiction, school bullyingâ€¦but typically in a Law and Order case of the week manner (although, kdramas typically air two episodes a week), so the treatment often seems superficial or even exploitative.
But with Mother, the entire show is about a woman rescuing a child from an abusive situation. This is not something I would normally tune into, but I'm a fan of the lead actress Lee Bo Young (although in her previous show Whisper, I tuned out after seeing her gamely chomp down on a product-placed Subway sandwich while plotting revenge against the corrupt law firm that frame her father).
Lee Bo Young's role in Mother is actually reminiscent of her portrayal of a fiercely protective mother in Nine Days who has somehow gone back in time nine days to prevent the impending death of her daughter. That series is another favorite of mine and costars
