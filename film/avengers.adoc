I was watching a Bloomberg interview of the Russo brothers, and they were a bit self-congratulatory on the diversity in Avengers: Endgame.

Sure, they have exemplary inclusion of non-human species. I’m not that impressed with their human diversity, though. I haven’t watched the movie, but from this cast listing, it just looks minimally diverse to me.

Of course, I’m always looking for Asian faces. But Asians who are Asian Asian (or outer space alien Asian) don’t count. That’s not really diversity, that’s more like tourism. I just want to see an Asian American kid who turns into Spiderman or an Asian American version of Tony Stark, not another Chinese monk or yakuza gangster or martial arts specialist.

But I have to admit, it’s still an improvement over this.
