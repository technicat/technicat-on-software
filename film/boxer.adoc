One of my regular Comic Con events is their Independent Film Festival, which shows short films all day followed by Q&A from the filmmakers. Besides just enjoying them as a filmgoer, listening to indies talk about how they got this done is always inspiring. (it really doesn’t matter whether it’s film, games, writing…)

This year, the IFF included a dramatic action film by my friend Toy Lei, which originated as a 72 Hour Shootout entry (the indie film equivalent of a game jam).
