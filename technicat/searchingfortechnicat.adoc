Searching for Technicat

Twenty years ago, I came up with the technicat name and registered the domain twenty years ago. My first choice was “technocat” but that was already taken even back then!

Now, I’m pretty happy with technicat, and I’ve been using it as my company name and registered it as a trademark, but you can’t plan for everything, like someone deciding that it’s a good name for a bait boat, as I’m painfully reminded whenever I google it.

On the bright side, maybe I’ll attract some customers from the fishing community! And at least my office cat video still shows up.
