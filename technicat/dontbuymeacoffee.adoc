It’s not Marie Kondo level, but occasionally I try to clean up my web site. In the latest pass, I removed the Buy Me a Coffee link.

I did get a couple of payments, but one from a person who apparently thought I was someone else who helped him out. It’s also yet another page to maintain and keep filled with content (I should probably cut down on Facebook pagese, too).

And I’m not a charity case (yet), so I’d rather stick to the capitalist route and get paid for my stuff (FYI, on itch.io, you can pay-what-you-want, and I’d like a million dollars please). And the web site does look a bit cleaner.
