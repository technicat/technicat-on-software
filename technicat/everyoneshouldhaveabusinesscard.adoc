Everyone Should Have a Business Card

At the new dim sum place I tried today, I casually picked up one of the business cards at the cashier and saw it was for Sam, the Delivery Boy. Then I looked at another one, and it was for the kitchen help. That is awesome.

I like business cards. They’re like business art. Or rather, graphic design. There’s the logo, there’s the layout, the color scheme, the fonts…I don’t even care about the name (my card doesn’t have my name on it, just the business name, logos and products). And the surface — glossy, matt…Check out that scene in American Psycho and you’ll see what I mean.

And I like handing out business cards. Besides the personal marketing aspect, when someone gives you a card, it’s nice to hand one back. If you don’t have one to hand back, you’re admitting you’re in the cardless underclass back at HQ. Or if you’re self-employed like me, you’re admitting you don’t have your act together (“darn, I ran out”).

I used to get business cards automatically, when I worked at big companies. Then after a while I had to ask for them. And when I got them, some employees would jealously complain they never got any. The last time I got business cards from an employer, they just ordered the cheap stock variety from Vistaprint. I could have done that myself. But I would have ordered something better.

Give everyone in your company business cards. It shows you consider them part of the company and you want everyone to know they’re part of the company. It gives them a way to brag about working for your company. It’s free advertising. Or close to free. Don’t cheap out. It’s the company badge. So make it look good.
