I’ve received some compliments on the logo for Fugu Games, so I thought it might be instructive to show the intermediate versions created by Shane Nakamura of Shane Nakamura Designs before the final version.

After asking me some questions to figure out what I was trying to communicate in a logo, Shane came up with a first pass of various ideas. He deliberately left them uncolored to avoid “coloring” my perceptions of these possible directions.

I really liked the cute round fugu character - I think it communicates the playfulness appropriate for computer video games (especially since I’m making casual, non-violent games). And I preferred the one with the vertical aspect ratio - I can’t really articulate why except that the border and lettering have a nice clean look.

But I also thought the side profile looked beautiful, in particular the one with the background that gave it a sort of classic Asian art look. So Shane made second pass with both logos in various colors.

In the end, I chose the cute guy (Shane suggested the name “Fugu Phil”), for the Fugu Games logo and registered that as a trademark. I think that was the right choice, as I received good comments when I submitted the logo to the IGDA studio affiliate site.

The side profile is more common among other products that use the “fugu” name. But Shane’s version is much better-looking than any of those, so I asked him for a final version of that one too, just in case I could find a use for it. I was thinking maybe t-shirts, coffee mugs, but it turns out the aspect ratio makes it perfect for the background splash/loading image on my Unity web games.
