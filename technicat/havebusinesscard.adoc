New address, new business card. This is one of those fun little activities that make you feel like you’re running a business, even if this is just one of the trappings of having a business, not the actual doing anything.

I went simple this time, just using Vistaprint and throwing in three logos. The cat is by Dakota Snow of Espress Yourself (I had no idea there’s a .coffee domain!); the fish is by Shane Nakamura of Shane Nakamura Designs (Shane also created an earlier Technicat logo and business card design), and the HyperBowl logo is from the HyperBowl archives and (I assume) created by Phil Zucco.
