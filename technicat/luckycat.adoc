I’ve always wanted to get one of those waving lucky cats you see in Asian restaurants and shops. The cat is actually a Japanese cat that is beckoning. It seems appropriate for Technicat (if I ever commission another logo, maybe I’ll make it one of those).

I saw a shelf of them at the International Marketplace the other day, and they were five bucks, which is cheaper than any of the food I bought there, and solar powered (I can’t be bothered with replacing batteries or winding them up). So why not.

And now I’m on my way toward a solar-powered home office.
