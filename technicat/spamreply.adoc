Simply unsubscribing from spam is unsatisfying. I want to waste as much spammer time as they’re wasting mine. But asking “How did you get my email address?” never elicits an answer (I really want to know), even when I’m replying to a person who wants to have a skype meeting.

So my latest idea is at least do a little marketing of my own, and although I don’t have my own spambot-replying-to-spambot setup, I made this pretend-I’m-a-bot sig. Maybe this will prompt some marketing reps to hit the unsubscribe link for me.
