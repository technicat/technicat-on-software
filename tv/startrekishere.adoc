The one thing I try to take away from a con is some cosplay photos. I just think it’s so cool to see people dressing up as a characters in a fictional universe that they enjoy so much. That’s why I checked out the Star Trek convention taking place this week at the Rio in Las Vegas. As soon as I arrived, I nearly bumped into a Ferengi and a Federation officer who for some reason was sporting a Bat’leth. Both were walking too fast for me to get a snapshot, but this charming lady obliged me.

I’m not a hard-core Star Trek fan, but I’m impressed how that long-lived franchise spans fans of all ages. From Comic Con to this con, my favorite cosplay are displayed by the Trekkies. Live long and prosper!
