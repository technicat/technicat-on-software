I recently listed my favorite shows from the past year

    The Good Place
    Dead to Me
    Killing Eve
    The Mandalorian
    Russian Doll
    Stranger Things
    The Handmaid’s Tale
    Veronica Mars
    Barry
    Watchmen

Only afterwards did I realize most of these shows featured female leads, and in fact most of them had women as their main protagonists. This was true of some of my past favorite shows but probably not most, and the pickings were slimmer. If I had to pick five off the top of my head, it’d be Buffy, Sarah Connor Chronicles, BSG, Deadwood, Breaking Bad, and that’s maybe two out of five (I always thought The Sarah Connor Chronicles was more about Sarah Connor than John Connor).

So, this is one of the few positive trends going into the new decade.
