Some things have become a lot more convenient now that they’re on the Internet. Travel planning and financial management, for example. But insurance still sucks. I just wasted two passes through Geico’s condo insurance application process. In the first, it timed out and presented a quote ID to continue later, but didn’t email it to the address I supplied, so I had to start over. I completed that one, and it told me to call an agent.

And then there’s Esurance. When I googled for “nevada condo insurance” they popped right up at the top of the search results.

And naturally, clicking on that brings up the esurance page to get a quote for “nevada condo insurance.”

Whereupon it tells you there they don’t have Nevada condo insurance.

Hey, you could have told me a page earlier. Or not served up that search result which leads to nothing. But I guess this is one way to get ad revenue. Maybe that’s their business model, now.
