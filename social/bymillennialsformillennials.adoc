By Millennials, For Millennials

I often think of Product Hunt (and sometimes the world) as implicitly promoting “by millennials, for millennials”, especially since I saw a boast on Product Hunt “We designed it for millennials!” (“It’s only for millennials?” “Other people can use it, too.”)

But now I see from this CES tweet (spelling aside) that it’s a real marketing thing.

Admittedly, “By millennials, for millennials” is catchy and rolls off the tongue, although I still like the extended version: “By millennials, for millennials. Other people can use it, too.”

Imagine if Gen-Y had never been rebranded, then they’d be stuck with a boring marketing label like us Gen-Xers, leaving the Baby Boomers as the champs. But even “Designed by Baby Boomers for Baby Boomers” sounds clunky. Is the Pepsi Generation still available?
