= Facebooked


One way to feel totally exploited is to go to your Facebook settings and look in the Ads section to see who’s been uploading your information for advertising purposes.


This makes me want to boycott not just Facebook but all these companies (or politicians, or scammers…) I’ll start with Facebook by deleting my account. I mean it this time. Also because they’re an existential threat to democracy.
