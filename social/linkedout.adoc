I’ve been complaining about LinkedIn since, well, a long time ago, but finally I followed through on my rhetoric and closed my account.

This is actually the second time I’ve bailed out of LinkedIn. I closed my account when it was still fairly new, after my connections started asking me for LinkedIn introductions, which I felt was a feature that punished me for having connections.

But then LinkedIn got popular enough I felt obligated to get back in (the Facebook effect). I did feel it was useful as a rolodex for keeping track of colleagues and for “where are they now?” queries, but these days I can just google for someone and even find them on LinkedIn without having a LinkedIn account.

I was also using it as an online resume, but it the didn’t look that great with the dated web site design. And recruiters contacting me on LinkedIn still invariably ask for a Word version, anyway (it’s called cut-and-paste, people, try it some time).

For a while,recruiters were the biggest annoyance, taking advantage of LinkedIn’s recruiter-spam offering which allows them to mass-email members with fake-personalized “I think you’d be a great fit, wait, what’s your background, send me your Word resume,” and sporting a recruiter-rating system that awards five stars to anyone who got more than a few replies to those fake-personalized emails.

So I toggled off my interested-in-jobs preference, which removed the job-hunting rationale for using LinkedIn. But still, most of the contact I’m still getting has been the unwanted kind. In the past year, I received messages and connection requests from:

    Mobile ad vendor offering to buy traffic in my Unity games, not knowing any of my games and not having a Unity plugin and not actually offering to buy anything.
    Numerous recruiter firms.
    A management consultant who just wanted to ask advice about selling comic books for a friend.
    Someone unhappy with his credit on a game I licensed.
    Random fake people (or maybe there really is an investment banker in Hong Kong who wants to connect).
    Random real people.

At which point I thought, why am I still on this thing?

So now I’m LinkedOut. And Facebook, those notifications I can’t turn off have been getting on my nerves, so watch out, you’re next.
