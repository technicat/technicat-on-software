On Unsplash

The Medium-recommended use of gratuitous stock images to banner every story is one reason I don’t check my Medium feed. Yes, what every tip on programming needs is a softly-lit photo of a laptop. Although I’ll take that over the lean millennial in a yoga position somehow solely occupying a beach and meditatively gazing at the sea, or on a cliff gazing at a valley…you get the idea (although, put on a mask and you have a great social distancing advert).

Nevertheless, I’ve started using Unsplash images while playing around with making Ren’Py games, and I figured I should make an account so I can at least like the images I’m using, and then I figured might as well upload some images.

I’ve started mostly with the same Las Vegas street art photos I’ve been uploading to Pinterest, but it seems people on Pinterest only care about food photos, and maybe this is a better venue for me to play artsy photographer and also give and not just take. So if you must precede all of your Medium stories with an unnecessary photo, try mine!
