I just saw this twitter ad by NBC News retweeting one of Trump’s attacks on the press.

It’s like they’re gluttons for punishment, for tweeting that as a headline in the first place, and then paying to retweet it as an ad. Great job, NBC, just do all his work for him. Also, terrible ad. It just makes me not want to watch NBC News.
