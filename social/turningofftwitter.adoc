Turning off Twitter

Well, I’m off twitter, and not just on a break (although I have 30 days to change my mind). I’ve been thinking about it for a few years, but it took a back seat to getting of facebook, instagram, whatsapp, tumblr, foursquare…

Anyway, looking at my join date clinched it.

There should be a rule of thumb, like not staying on a social media network for more than ten years (kind of like moving around — don’t want to get too settled).

It wasn’t easy to hit the Deactivate button (actually, it was pretty easy compared to the hoops you have to jump through cancel your Amazon account), it seems like I get all my tech news and world news on twitter, and once you find enough people to follow it feels like you’re in a cool club.

But it’s a cool club floating in a sewer, and every day I feel the need to shower off the coronavirus and twitter’s blend of stupidity and toxicity. I almost deleted twitter last year, but I managed to make it tolerable by unfollowing everyone and putting them in lists instead, changing my content location to South Korea so the Trends section showed up in Korean copious muting of words and blocking of users, and using non-official twitter clients like Friendly and Tweetbot. In other words, I can only stand using twitter by not using it as intended.

So, at some point you have to know it’s time or past time to break up.

And twitter doesn’t seem all that broken up about it.
