I just realized a good portion of my photos were of my (late) cat. I don’t want to look like one of those people who spend all their time posting cat photos on Facebook, and while I’m not ready for a #DeleteFacebook commitment (most of the feedback for my HyperBowl and Talk Dim Sum apps are on Facebook pages), I’m all in for #DeleteSomeStuffFromFacebook. So I removed those photos.

But I don’t want to lose them, so I’m posting them here. There are way too many Medium stories with photos of people meditating on the beach or contemplating their coffee while working on their laptop (or the reverse). More cat pictures, please.
