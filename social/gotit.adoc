I like this new GDPR-policed Internet in which web sites ask you “Please, may we give you some cookies?” But some are still trying to avoid the dreaded opt-out. I got this popup when I visited about.me just now.

“Got it”? What does that mean? “Got it, I’ve finished reading this sentence, go away, popup”, or “Got it, I’ve finished reading the Cookie Policy and now I want to take a nap,” or “Got it, give me those cookies!” It’s probably not, “Got it, let me get back to you on that cookie thing.”
