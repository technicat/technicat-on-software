Twitter Lists

Call me old-fashioned, but I like my social media feeds to be filled with posts by people I follow, not people followed by people I follow, or liked by people I follow, or just “suggested” by some creepy stalker AI.

Which is why I don’t even read Medium, anymore (I just like writing on it), and why I switched to Tweetbot on my iPad. But I still use regular twitter on my Android phone and I do like the search features on regular twitter.

Back when I switched to Tweetbot, some of my Twitter followers suggested using twitter lists, and takes me a year to get around to following someone’s advice, so now I’ve created a bunch of lists and moving my followees onto them.

So now instead of getting mad at my feed, I do a quick check on my lists, although I find I spend most of my time on the developers list.

Twitter doesn’t really highlight list membership (I’m on quite a few but never receive notifications about that), so I don’t know how enthusiastic they are about it, and sorry everyone for decrementing your follower count. But if I’m still following you, that means I haven’t figured out how to categorize you yet and you’re unlisted!
