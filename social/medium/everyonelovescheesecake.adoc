Cheesecake is one of my favorite things, dating back to when I was a kid and a neighbor brought over her homemade cheesecake. And I know it’s not just me. An Indian friend in college who normally wouldn’t eat eggs would ask me to please don’t tell him if there are eggs in it whenever my Mom had a cheesecake care package sent to me from Vermont.

It’s also the secret to popularity on Medium. Here I’ve been wasting time writing stories that get a handful of views (like this one), when all I had to do was glom a three-sentence response onto someone else’s widely-read story (I know, this is taught in Trolls 101) and mention cheesecake. And hey, I don’t claim to be a market mover, but Barnes and Noble stock just went up.
