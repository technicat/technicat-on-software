The Blog Is Back

You probably haven’t noticed, but this account has been offline for about a week. I only realized it after someone on twitter informed me that accessing my stories resulted in a suspended or 404 not found page. I could see all my stories fine while logged into Medium, but then I tried logging out and yep, 404 Not Found.

Then I checked my stats page and yikes.

I tried reporting the issue via the Medium chatbot, but it doesn’t seem to pay attention well. After asking me to state my problem it just says sorry you’re having a problem, would you like to contact support and please state your problem again.

I didn’t receive any response from this, or the email I sent, or a query on twitter, and I spent the weekend thinking about where to host my future blog (or futureblog, somehow that sounds like a thing), but late Monday I saw the blog is back.

So I guess I’ll keep using Medium, but from now on I’ll be checking if the blog is visible (or at least check the stats for zero bars), and keeping an eye out for alternatives. You know, just in case.
