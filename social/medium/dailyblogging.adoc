Daily Blogging on Medium

One casualty of my move off of Dreamhost was my daily blogging. I left because it seemed to me the service hadn’t improved over seven years and they didn’t even notice my most recent mail outage (“the server was a hater so it took down the file server” was the hipster dudester explanation I got from support), but I have to admit they did have pretty good Wordpress support, better than my new host, Arvixe (“Can I close the ticket, now?” is the usual support response I get from them. I miss the hipster dudester).

So I went into blogger limbo, not really getting into Tumblr (it’s OK for liking, reblogging, posting photos, but actually writing? Plus I keep thinking Yahoo will ruin it). And Medium…great for writing, but it struck me as a place for writing great masterful essays, not daily bits and pieces, and not a respository of all one’s writing.

Supporting this impression, in my first burst of recycled essays, one has nearly 12k views so far, and the next most popular one has 29. And I wouldn’t even know how to search among my own writing here if I had a year’s worth.

But the reason I started daily blogging wasn’t for fame and fortune, it was for practice, or more accurately, exercise. The great writers write daily (well, maybe not all of them — at least one or two I heard of). And poor writers should write daily (or if they do, maybe they shouldn’t). Anyway, like exercise, if I stop the daily routine, it’s hard to start again, but if I keep going, it becomes a sort of compulsion.

So, be forewarned, now commenceth the daily blogging, even if I have to recycle old writing (that’s sort of cheating, but think of it as a backup of my old blogs). Starting…now.
