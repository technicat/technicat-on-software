Pinterest Is My New Interest

I started using Pinterest for quite a while before I got sucked into Instagram, and I’ve been interested in getting back into it for something, largely because it’s not owned by Facebook, and also I like their engineering blog.

So this year I set up a dim sum board for my dim sum app, with sections for individual types of dim sum.

The sections mirror the set of dishes depicted in my app.

The associated pinterest section is included in the list of available web resources for that dish, which you can bring up by tapping on the bottom left info button.

Selecting the pinterest link will bring you to that section of the dim sum board in the pinterest app (or web page if you don’t have pinterest installed)

Aside from being an excuse to use pinterest, this does provide additional info for each dish: more photos, recipes, etc. and it’s an excuse not to implement my own support to display multiple images for each dish (although I suppose now I could use the pinterest sdk and integrate the dim sum board into my app).

Also, it turns out the dim sum board on its own is getting plenty of social media activity.
