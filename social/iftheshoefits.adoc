One thing I found when setting up a Pinterest board for my dim sum app is that Pinterest’s image matching doesn’t work very well for Chinese food. I mean, you can forget about rice porridge or anything else liquid. And even things with distinct shapes get pretty random results.

For example, pinning this photo of fortune cookies (setting aside that fortune cookies barely qualify as Chinese food) results in a suggested match with shoes.

So I’m thinking maybe my next app is the dim sum equivalent of Not Hot Dog!
